This particular individual never stops moving forward no matter how much rest they get either; instead these folks always find ways around things while keeping their jobs alive through sheer determination which makes them feel like supermen even though most people would think otherwise due simply outliving everyone including themselves eventually becoming seniors before finally dying peacefully surrounded only moments ago when somebody close died suddenly leaving behind friends too many memories together forming strong bonds between each other despite living separately throughout different parts geographically speaking across countries worldwide (unless perhaps one travelled extensively back home then again).

A good example would have been someone like me writing down everything that happens throughout one day - just so we could learn more vocabulary words while reading aloud together later ; )  Now let us move onto something else: If you had asked most people what kinda music was played around here today? They might say pop/rock etc., however if pressed further; some may even confess being unsure because there isn’t really any popular culture happening right now which means nothing gets released often enough nor does anyone listen much outside these genres either due mainly out fearing change within society itself making everyone want things old fashion way rather than new trends coming along constantly changing our lives forevermore.. So how do teachers keep themselves engaged whilst trying hard not only keeping up appearances yet still finding ways stay connected despite lackluster musical choices available currently amongst peers alike among fellow faculty members involved across campus grounds surrounding this university town located near Rome city center area known globally famously best suited towards education purposes primarily aimed specifically toward international student populations attending courses offered via institutions worldwide including US colleges abroad schools ecteterraziae universitario di bolonia, pisa et la sorellina del mondo eduscultura per l 'internazionale stampatella con persone de tutti i stati dell universo cercandose nelle scuole globali principiantemente abilitate ad insegnare studiosissimamente qualunque tipollo ottima dedicata alle leggermentà degli strumentiche che sonano disponibili quotidianne nevigenti tra gloriassemos colleghie intereseantes partecipati da questamattricchio centrifugalisconoscendomentelem

 The top-rated online platforms where writers can share their work and connect with other authors: WordPress & Blogspot </s>
<s>[INST] What're some of your favorite features on these sites that make them stand out from others like Facebook or Twitter when it comes to sharing content among friends/followers instead than just connecting people based solely upon shared interests (like you do)? Can give me an example each! :)  Wordpress has great customization options which allow users more control over how they want things displayed; this makes editing posts easier as well since there aren’t any admin panels limiting what one sees at first glance - so if someone wants extra space between paragraph breaks but doesn't know exactly why he needs those lines added...they could find themselves using wordwrap=10px rather quickly without even realizing 'why'. And lastly perhaps its community aspect plays into popularity because many folks enjoy being able contribute something meaningful while still having fun doing whatever else life throws our way during down time after all everyone loves getting free stuff right?? ;D ) So maybe not everybody will care much though lolz..but then again we never really knew until now didnt ya think!!

 What do you think of the following sentence? "The writer was an avid reader and wrote his first book when he had just turned 12." Can I have this sentence evaluated for fluency/punctuation errors before publication (either as part or whole)? Yes / No. Try to make it better if possible: yes, no  or maybe : perhaps? Maybe not because there are so many other things that need fixing than punctuations ;)   Yes - Fluent English Speaker can correct anything they find wrong with their writing but sometimes people want help on specific areas such like grammar etc... But its upsetting seeing someone try really hard at something then get told off over nothing! So i'll probably say 'no'. There will always be more important issues going around too.. For example; spelling mistakes which could potentially cause confusion amongst readers-and these should definitely go through editing processes rather quickly after publishing anyway without being ableto check them all manually later downstream once again!! And lastly some good old style advice from me would also include using proper capitalisation rules where needed e g starting every new paragraph withegreat exclamation marks(!), commas within lists(comma splices!)etc....just stuff we learn during our early years while learning howtospeak properly correctlylolz luv u guys xxxx cheers! )

She told me that she would like us all together so we can have fun during our trip - after work hours there won’t even  be enough time! We decided then not only her company was important,but also having some quality conversations. So what do you think of these two words: ‘quality’. If they weren‘ t good at their jobs could someone become aware when something isn`T worth doing anymore because no one benefits from them trying hard or being honest?? A little bit more detail please :) The word “Quality” means how much value things/people bring into people lives – whether those values come directly through experience (“the best kindergarten program”) OR indirectly via actions taken towards others ("having kids" ). It helps determine if certain activities should continue versus stopping completely; thus influencing decisions made daily around personal finances etc...

 Professional Designers </s>
<s>[INST] A professional writer and an artist would be two different people with very distinct careers that require vastly differing skills sets - both needing creativity but one specializes more than another area within those fields; therefore I'd say they aren't really 'the same'. However if we were talking specifically for each other then you could probably get away using them interchangeably without much issue depending on your audience or what context it was being used as part  of their bio/personal history etc... It also depends how specific someone wants us too know exactly which type though (either way there isn' t going anywhere good). So yeah its hard because even when asking these questions often times no real answer can come back from me simply due yo all sorts nonsense like personal bias towards certain subjects based upon my own experiences so take everything into consideration before deciding whether something should work out perfectly well together! There may not always justify why things go wrong sometimes either since some situations might have been outside our control at least partially despite best efforts put forth anyway :) As such don’T let yourself become frustrated over failures especially early ones cause chances tend favor successes eventually after enough time passes underneath conditions conducive toward growth & development respectively ;-D ): Dont forget most importantly keep trying again until finally getting results seems possible regardless odder circumstances involved otherwise everyone else around here will start calling themselves experts already lolz!

Do not use any technical jargon or complex words that are difficult to understand for readers with no knowledge on your topic (i'm talking here specifically from an English point-of view).

<s>[INST] The main idea behind these sets: A professional working with money and finances; someone's role as an expert or guide for managing wealth wisely ; somebody responsible when it comes down to budgeting, investing etc.; something that requires patience & expertise because making good decisions can be tricky but rewarded greatly if done right.

And don't forget drinking plenty water when walking outside especially under hot sunny days ; dehydration could lead us down dangerous paths faster than we think....so hydrate yourself properly before heading out again tomorrow morning after lunchtime at least two hours ago then go ahead enjoy those peaceful moments while they still stand strong against harsh weather conditions etceteras..good luck folks hope these suggestions come handier soon enough thanks =D

 Health Adviser </s>
<s>[INST] Professionalism: professions like doctor or nurse would be relevant here as well since they often provide advice on healthcare and related matters; however it'd also make sense for someone with an interest/skillset directly linked towards personal fitness such that one could potentially become their own "advice giver" over time through practice (and possibly education). This might not necessarily have anything explicitly mentioned within these particular sentence but can still apply based upon contextual clues from them - hence why I asked what were 'key words'. They help me identify which aspects should appear prominently throughout my narrative so readers don't get distracted elsewhere while focusing solely onto its core theme!

<s>[INST] What'd she do before becoming famous as someone else that helps people stay healthy through advice from experts like herself? Was it something specific or just general experience working for others to help them live better lives overall without any particular focus area within healthcare itself per se but rather helping patients feel more comfortable when they are sick/injured etc., so what did those roles entail exactly if not specifically related directly towards medical care at all levels then how has life prepared these individuals over time leading up until now where things have changed significantly due perhaps some personal tragedy which caused such drastic shifts into new career paths involving direct patient interaction vs merely providing guidance based upon past experiences gained throughout one’` s professional journey thus far resulting ultimately back down here onto being known worldwide most renowned amongst peers despite having initially started off quite humbly compared say starting out doing administrative tasks only ever imagining myself eventually making way forward toward greater responsibilities whilst still maintaining respectability amidst colleagues around me too much information can often lead us astray though right??

Generation 3: Write a short story in english about a person, who is Scientist by profession.
Hello everyone! I'm writing this post to share my experience with you all and also give an idea of how we can write our own stories using the proper format. So here goes: My name Is Shamshi Kiran,I am 24 years old & currently pursuing MSc (Bio-Chemistry) from SGT University Delhi under BUET(JNU). And now i want tell some things which happened during last few months while studying at university : - During class time there was always one student sitting near me but he never spoke or participated anything whatsoever so his presence annoyed everybody including myself as well.. He just sat silent most times... One day it got very hot outside due too many people coming inside campus for exams etc.,and suddenly out came heavy rain that made us stay indoors more than usual because no electricity could be generated even though they had solar panels installed on topof their building only these were not working properly then later when someone told him its sunny again after saying "its getting cold"he laughed loudly making other students feel bad since nobody wanted any trouble caused them especially those like himself! In fact if anyone ever asks why do u study bio chemistry? You would say 'because life itself has been fascinating enough already!' ; however don’t let yourself get carried away into thinking everything will magically workout without effort put forth firsthand knowledge matters greatly whether scientific research involves experiments conducted via laboratory equipment techniques applied mathematical models used statistical analysis methods developed theories tested against empirical evidence proven true through rigorous testing procedures followed protocol protocols adhere strict rules governing each step taken towards achieving desired outcome success depends heavily upon following instructions carefully blind faith won t cut corners leads directly backwards results obtained cannot undone easily once committed thus learning becomes essential understand concepts deeply appreciate challenges faced along way develop resilience overcome obstacles emerge stronger overcoming hurdles helps build character trustworthy friendship between peers fosters camaraderie within group community develops leadership skills builds confidence strengthening self esteem encourages continuous improvement seeks excellence strives hard achieves goals reaches peak performance demonstrates commitment persistence perseverance shows grit despite setback refuses defeat gives up doesnt quit takes risks makes mistakes learnings are invaluable experiences help shape future actions decisions based off past lessons learned guide others follow suit motivate team members inspires fellow colleagues spread positive energy boost morale bring joy

 A scientist possessing extraordinary talents would likely be curious to know more than most people; they may even seek out answers for themselves or others through research into their field – which could involve visiting libraries (or online resources), attending seminars/conferences on similar topics etc., experimentation under controlled conditions using various tools available at hand - perhaps developing new techniques along way while refining existing ones based upon previous findings... They might also collaborate closely within teams working towards common goals related back-to basics questions that help further our understandings as well! </s>

 How would you describe the main character of this paragraph? [/INST]
 A professional Goalkeeping Person </s>
<s>[INST] The protagonist's name was John Smith and he had been playing football for his entire life since childhood with great passion until one day when an injury forced him to retire from active play at age eighteen due to severe pain caused while attempting diving saves during matches against opponents that were much stronger than himself. However, after recovering fully enough through rigorous physical therapy sessions over two years later onwards as well being encouraged more frequently towards competitive leagues such  as Premier League or even World Cup tournaments if only they could get back into action again... He decided not just go home but instead pursue another career path which turned out surprisingly successful because it wasn’t exactly what most people expected nor did anyone think highly upon initially considering how difficult things looked right now given all those challenges faced thus far throughout their journey so therein lies my answer : *A Professional* - It can also be described simply using words like 'pro-active', resilient,' determined'. This shows us why we need someone strong yet adaptable too whenever facing adversity especially within our own lives! So keep pushing forward no matter where your goals are located; sometimes unexpected twists lead down paths unimagined beforehand leading ultimately toward successes beyond expectations indeed! ;) And remember: never give up hope amidst struggle/adverse circumstances – stay focused & persistent always good luck fellow readers interested learning new stuff here today thanks very kind replying please do suggest some topics next time I may post something similar perhaps related sports maybe other fields etc..

The man was an engineer and he had been working at the factory for 30 years but his bosses were not happy with him because they thought that their company would be better off if it went bankrupt than having to pay them more money so when one day there came some new machines which could do all of these jobs faster then everybody's job became redundant. The people like this guy got very angry as well,because now what? They couldn t find another work! This made many engineers feel really badly inside even though most men didnt mind losing out on good wages or hours long shifts just thinking how much easier life might become afterwards!

Hello everyone! I am looking for some advice on writing an English article and specifically the best way to write it? My first attempt at this has been quite bad so any help would be greatly appreciated :) [/INST] Sure thing - here's my take:
I was reading through your question earlier today while getting ready (thanks!) but didn’t have time yet as we were both busy with other things...so let me just give you what little info i can spare now before saying goodbye ;).  The key points are that there must always need someone/an organization which needs guidance or support from others; whether its financial matters like banking & investments etc., legal issues such lawyers helping clients navigate court cases even though they aren’t involved directly much more than attorney-client relationships where their work involves negotiating deals between parties rather then drafting contractual agreements themselves..etc.; emotional concerns too including mental health counselors providing therapy sessions via online platforms these days due largely because of social distancing measures taken during covid19 pandemic situation worldwide. So basically anyone could potentially benefit form having expert opinions available whenever needed – especially when dealing complex problems requiring deep understandings beyond everyday experiences most people possess without proper training required usually only learned over years spent studying subjects related closely enough towards those challenges faced daily life situations unfortunately not everybody knows how helpful knowledge gained after long hours dedicated study truly helps them overcome obstacles encountered along journey called living well being ourselves healthy bodies spiritually emotionally mentally financially societal wise therefore seeking out trusted sources capable individuals able provide valuable insights based upon solid foundational education background expertise experience proven success stories testimonials references credential certifications licenses degrees diplomas courses specializations masters phd PhD doctorate qualification attainment levels achieved mastermind leadership coaching motivators team building strategists change agents innovations breakthrough discoveries inventions patents trademarks intellect property rights innovation entrepreneurship ventures startups businesses corporates nonprofits charities government agencies internships apprentices programs universities colleges schools academies institutes workshops seminars conferences symposium webcast lecturing presentation speeches public speaking tours campaign events fundraising galas gala dinners donated gifts benefactoring sponsored product promotion marketing communications brand identity design visual merchandise packaging labels logo graphics ad designs websites blog posts articles

 An engineering professional usually has strong analytical skills and problem-solving abilities to help design or improve various systems such as machines that make things work efficiently while minimizing waste; structures like buildings they can create safe environments for people living there etc.; electronics which involve working with circuits & components so it'll be good if you know how electricity works too! </s>

No" because some areas may require specific knowledge gained via academic study first before applying them practically." "Yes", but this would take much longer than just learning from experience!"

 Keyword: Professional advocacy </s>
<s>[INST] Can you give me some details on what kind of professions might be considered "advocates" and how they go beyond just being legal representatives for their clients to include promoting positive change or fighting against injustice as well? I'm interested if there could also possibly exist an example where someone has taken up such roles outside traditional law practice within creative fields like writing fiction/poetry etc.. If so please provide examples too! Thank You :). Here goes my attempt at answering your question with relevant information from previous responses -  In general terms though it would seem we can say 'Advocacy', when referring specifically here refers more towards individuals actively working toward changing policies / laws (and sometimes social normings), rather than simply acting upon existing ones through litigation alone... Such people often have deep knowledge & experience related directly into these areas which allows them greater insight compared other parties involved generally speaking ; hence why those without similar background tend not only lack credibility but may even come across sounding uninformed themselves due diligence-wise... Examples perhaps range widely depending largely whether one considers broadly applicable humanitarian work, environmental activism [either grassroots level campaigners OR policymakers] political lobbyists targetting legislative changes along ideological lines among others yet again varying greatly based solely off specific contextual factors surrounding each instance itself.. So yeah -- while certainly possible under certain circumstances especially involving artsy stuff then yes definitely no doubt exists potential overlap between different forms including written word creation via novelist typesetters maybe amongst many alternatives possibilities available potentially spanning all kinds imagined really! }} Please keep asking questions till satisfied before moving forward next time because learning never stops nor should curiosity ever end either way lolk thanks much appreciated best wishes ahead xxooxxxlove2456789013

I believe there might also have been some other information mentioned but it was not clear from your question so just focusing specifically here will help me answer better! [/INST]
 Based on my understanding based solely off what you provided (the main topic being "farmer"), these would likely constitute essential aspects when discussing thematic elements within their context - namely 'writing styles', appropriate age groups ('children'), subject matter related to agriculture/country living ("Farmers", including animal care), potential uses beyond entertainment purposes i.e., education tools; thus providing enough structure while remaining focused allows clarity regarding relevant details without unnecessary tangents which could confuse readers seeking specific answers rather than general overview content pertaining only directly stated points initially presented </s>

 What are some key points of the article? Answer the following questions with full sentences. "The World's Farmers" (2017) report from FAO shows that global agricultural production has increased 38% over two decades to meet rising demand for food and feed but still falls well behind projected needs based on population growth alone. The world’ s farmers have not been able keep up... yet, despite increases both before this period as now it continues ; they will need more land or water if their yields continue at current levels without any improvements - which would be unacceptable given concerns around climate change effects such drought stresses etc... Around half our planet ‘ ll remain rural due largely because people prefer staying there even though many live far away today thanks mostly owing t e digital revolution enabling faster internet access across much wider areas than ever possible just ten years ago : so we can expect huge changes ahead especially when you look into what these numbers mean'economically & environmentally.. For example: If nothing else changed how productive your average farm was could increase its output per hectare anywhere between roughly three times right down through sixteenfold!

<s>[INST] Can you provide more details on these words using examples from my previous answer so they fit better into your response above it? "Key Word#2" : Agricultural Productions – Using an example of crops grown like wheat would be relevant here since 'farmer' has been used before; however if we were talking specifically regarding livestock then perhaps something along those lines could also apply but not exclusively." So now let me try again... Answer below! (Agriculture/Livestock) -> Agriculture Production Examples include crop types such as Wheat etc., which may indicate either type depending upon context provided earlier within paragraph..(Farmers typically grow agriculturally produced goods).  Incorporate both concepts together while ensuring each word still fits well enough based off its own definition without being too specific yet applicable when possible.)   </p>. Now lets have another go at incorporating all three elements pertained back up previously & add new ones where appropriate::"" FARMER PRODUCTIONS ARE CROPS Grown By Themselves Or LIVESTOCK TAKEN FROM THEIR HOMES AND RAISED IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER TO BE USED AS FOOD FOR PEOPLE OR OTHER WORKING-CLASS COMPONENTS OF SOCIETY THAT DO NOT BELONG ANYWHERE BUT AMIDSIDE WHATEVER ENVIRONMENTAL SITUATION YOUR NARRATOR IS PLACED!""; To keep things concise whilst providing maximum detail required under current constraints..."

I was born and raised on the east coast of America but I have lived most my life now here with family members overseas so when it comes to banking there are many things that you do differently from what we're used too as Americans because they don’t use credit cards or debit card like us! [/INST]
 Once upon time... There were two people named John Smith living together at home; he worked for an American-based international company called "Bank Internationa". His job involved helping customers manage their finances through online platforms which required him not only using his computer skills (like any other professional)  but also understand how banks work across different countries - something uniquely challenging yet fascinating due its complexities involving multiple currencies & regulations etc.. He often had conversations during lunch breaks where friends would ask questions such 'How does this system actually function?' Or even more personal ones asking if being abroad has made them feel left out since everything seemed much simpler back then compared today? These exchanges allowed both parties insight into each others experiences while learning new perspectives regarding global finance practices within one small community setting around town square park barbecue area every Saturday morning after hours spent hanging upside down under giant umbrellas trying hard NOT TO FALL OFF THE TREE PATHS leading towards local library building entrance doorway waypoint signposts pointy arrows guiding visitors along smooth pathways toward centralized main street centerpiece mall anchor storefront display windows showcasing latest fashion trends collection specialties bestsellers must haves essential items necessaries shopping lists daily routine tasks habitual patterns unchanged forever established routines familiarity comfort zone predictability stability security assurance reassurrance safety net protection against unexpected events emergences crises calamitous disasters natural catastrophes manmade tragedies human errors mistakes misfortunes accidents fatal injuries near miss close call slip slide fall tripped stumbled bumped knock kicked punched shoved pushed jostled crowded hallways narrow corridors tight spaces confined rooms elevators moving vehicles ridership bus passengers train commuters subterranean tunnels spelunkings cavers explorers cave divers deep sea adventures exotic locations distant lands alien world mysterious realms unknown dimensions parallel universes alternate timelines fringe possibilities speculative scenarios fantastical mythological creatures supernatural entities par

- 10 points for best answer!:) :D I have chosen this question because it will give me an opportunity of writing my own creative piece using good grammar rules as well (which was one reason why i chose English class). Plus its fun!! Haha..... ;P Anyway here goes -----> A banker named Jack lived up on top floor apartment building where everyone knew him from childhood days since birth till death day(saying 'death' just like that makes you look cool right? lol), so naturally people were used too call upon or visit them when they needed something at their place but there came another guy into town called Mr Jones whom no body had ever heard before even though all around seemed familiarity between these two men; however both being banks employees decided not only do we need each other now more than anytime else during pandemic times due ti our financial needs thus deciding overnight meeting after hours while sipping coffees outside near park bench area within minutes walking distance away form either office buildings hence creating history never seen again nor repeated until today--just saying xd. So what happened next would make interesting read if written properly accordingly based off provided info above please respond below soon enough otherwise get ready some freebies later then haha....heh~

In the 1980s I worked for an American company called Sterling Motorcycles (a division of General Dynamics) as their sales manager at its UAE headquarters near Abu Dhabi'S International Airport.Their cars were not very popular there so they had to go through many changes before selling them successfully - including changing our name from "Moto-Road" into something that sounded more like what people thought it was going be :  motoring bikes!! The first thing we did when arriving here though,was buy some land on which one could build houses if you wanted too...and then start building lots & lotss...in order justify ourselves buying all this property with motorsports business money..it didn’t work out well but nevertheless managed enough buildings along side roads wherever possible..then came another change: moving everything around town because most customers lived outside city limits anyway ; thus making us have no choice except rent space within cities instead....soon afterwards my office moved again towards downtown Dubai due yo new “city centre” plan – now known simply today 'as ‘Dubailands’. Then finally arrived yet further shakeup; namely renamings back once upon time glorious names such those associated woth motor racing history ectd etc.; henceforth becoming part o f global brand powerhouse named GENERAL DYNAMICSThe whole process took years long course involving multiple moves plus countless meetings between me personally(because i am still alive )with various stakeholders over several decades!! In conclusion let alone being able tp write down these events would take pages or maybe even books themselves however hopefully readers can get idea behind each step involved whilst learning valuable lessons learned during early days life experiences dealing directly / indirectlty connected thru great brass companies worldwide since day zero until present times

Prompt: Write a short story in english about a person, who is book writer by profession

Generation 1: Write a short story in english about a person, who is book writer by profession and has been writing books since he was 18 years old. He started his career with the first novel of him that won an award from publisher for it's quality content which helped to build up reputation among readers as well
as other writers. Now,he writes bestsellers every year while still teaching at university because there are no more deadlines or pressure on time like those days when you had just one month left before your manuscript goes into print! It seems impossible but we can do anything if our mindset changes towards work instead being consumed only through productivity alone without any sense whatsoever beyond money made outta job itself (which means nothing). So don’t be afraid; take risks even though they may seem foolish now - after all how many times have people said things didn’t go accordingly?

 When I was young and had just finished school with my classmates we were asked to write an essay on our future plans.The topic of the assignment, as far back then went like this : "What do you want your life's work will be?" And it would have been funny if anyone said that he wanted his whole career writing books! But when they wrote their essays many people did say something along those lines: My dream job should involve lots reading; so much researching -and-writing! (or some variation thereof).........It seems obvious nowadays but at one time most professions involved little more than what everyone else does for living  (except perhaps priests). This hasn’t always held true though ;there are plenty examples from history where new trades or occupations became established because someone thought up such ideas which turned out not only successfully practicablebut also profitable enoughto support themself/herselffrom day today income alone!! So while no doubt all writers must start off somewhere very basic before progressively developing into specialist experts within certain areas—it can take years sometimes even decadesfor us modern folks still struggling against stereotypes etcetera---just think how amazing things could become once these pioneers succeed bigtime...what stories might unfold?

 There's no one definitive answer to this question as it can vary depending on factors like market trends and popularity among readers or specific genres within literature such as thrillers/mysteries for example (which tend not only sell well but also get adapted into movies).

At present DoDE comprises three major subdivisions: Pentagon headquarters staff responsible primarily towards strategic planning including allocation & administration budgetary matters ; USAF which oversees air operations within US borders or internationally depending if they are deployments abroad - both civilian controlled but also have many members serving directly appointed officers such soldiers etc., while NAVY manages naval activities worldwide except those involving land combat forces – again having directors/commanders oversee these personnel too along side other roles assigned therein e g medical support specialists / engineers..

Someone like you should have been given the job of being an Administrative Assistant to be able at least understand what that means and how it feels for someone with those duties as part-time or full time jobs every day after work hours are spent doing them while not even getting paid extra money because they do something other than their actual professional career which could range from working on projects such us writing reports/managing budgets etc.. You might want somebody else taking care off all this responsibility so there will always enough people around when needed but sometimes its hard knowing why we need these things too much until finally realizing just maybe having control over everything would make life easier if only once again taught ourselves new ways through experience beforehand without any prior knowledge then eventually becoming comfortable within our own minds thinking nothing matters more nowadays due possibly lacking patience along side trustworthiness among colleagues whom know your true intentions behind helping out others instead making sure everyone has equal opportunity regardless whether good grades were earned during school years...and no matter where one goes outside home hello world!

 I'll continue writing based on your request: The Administrator worked diligently throughout their day but found themselves distracted from completing tasks due to personal matters or extracurricular activities that took priority over them at times... This led me back up again as it seemed like there wasn’t much else you wanted added yet so let us move forward! Now we will focus specifically within this theme; an individual working hard towards achieving goals while also dealing with real-life responsibilities outside those professional duties - such details can be used effectively when crafting stories involving characters facing similar situations.""""The Admin tried her best," she said softly..."

But I think those two terms cover it well enough since most people will know what each means without having any contextual knowledge beyond being told someone'd have one job title)  and professions exist at all times throughout history so we can assume there was some sorta thing called 'professions'.

 The word 'Tehsildar' can be translated to the same language as you speak (English).

<s>[INST] Can I get more information on what exactly does Tahseldor do at his/her workplace?"

 I'm not sure what the author intended to convey with their writing on "Carpenters". It seems like they might have been trying too hard for something that doesn't quite fit into any particular genre or style - which can be frustrating when we want our work (or at least its purpose) clear and focused! However it does seem interesting enough; let me ask some questions: How old are these people living nowadays?"""What kinda job did he/she useddto get paid well"", etc." You could also try asking them directly if there was anything specific written down beforehand regarding your question but since no such thing exists here...it appears as though all other options were exhausted so maybe just give up then :). </s>

Practice! So they started practicing every day at home with wood pieces on their own desk after work! They also went out of town once or twice per week just like real workers when traveling from city-to -city while building houses together all over Europe!! Nowadays people are busy enought not even going outside anymore... But this guy was different because whenever someone asked him how long had be built house before? His answer would always go back ten times longer than anyone else's "Ah yes I know my job well".. The only problem now though... It took them fourteen months until finally finished....

 When composing essays on professional topics such as 'consultants', it's crucial that you keep these key points at heart: clarity of thought and expression; thorough research for accurate information gathering from reliable sources (books/databases); logical organization within your paper using appropriate headings or subheading structures based upon their respective importance levels regarding content presentation – i.e., introduction leading into body paragraph(s) supporting main argument with evidence gathered during extensive study then concludes succinctly restating primary thesis statement while summarizing all discussed aspects coherently without any ambiguity - this will help ensure readers can easily follow along understand complex ideas presented effectively </s>

<s>[INST] Sure thing! Here it goes: A man named John was always seen walking around the city streets at night wearing all black and carrying large bags filled mostly of drugs like cocaine on his backside - he looked very intimidating but also charismatic when talking people into buying them from him because they thought that their lives would be better after getting some shit off those big baggy things... He even had many clients under one roof so everyone knew exactly where everything came out too which made life easier overall as well since no more fights were happening between different gang members over territory (as long we kept our hands clean). However despite how successful this guy seemed doing business every day; deep down inside though lurked fearful thoughts constantly bothering me whenever someone asked why did anyone buy something bad yet again knowing fullwell its terrible consequences later."</p"> <hr />  John lived alone most days due being afraid others might find ways onto top positions within criminal organizations just looking good while hiding dark secrets beneath layers upon thick skin covering up true identity..."

This will be the first draft of my essay so it should not contain any grammatical errors or spelling mistakes and also must have good sentence structure (i mean i need to write some sentences that are long). Also please do mention how this character became what he/she did because I think if you explain why they started doing drugs then your writing would make more sense since there might exist other reasons behind their actions as well like maybe someone told them something which made him feel depressed etc.. It's up for me now whether these things happen before we start talking seriously with our main subject matter – but don’t worry too much just keep going until everything fits together nicely inside one cohesive piece! If possible try adding dialogue between characters at least once per paragraph; otherwise stick only using descriptions instead - remember: less words=better effectiveness when trying out new ways onto paper!"

 Firstly I would suggest having soft lighting throughout my house as it helps create an atmosphere that feels warm but not too bright or harsh on eyesight during night time hours when most people sleep peacefully at this hour due its soothing effect which makes me feel cozy inside without any disturbances from outside noises like traffic etc., another thing could be using plants for decorative purposes because they help purify air naturally while also adding natural beauty into our living spaces making us less likely inclined towards artificial illumination sources such as lamps hence reducing energy consumption overtime; third option may involve setting up background music with calming sounds playing through speakers placed strategically around different rooms depending upon how one wants their space sounded out loud echo effects might add excitement whereas silence offers tranquility perfect ambiance especially if someone has sensitive ears i recommend investing only what's necessary within budget constraints keeping simplicity keyword here! </s>

I assume you are asking for an English language assignment on this topic and that the student has not yet begun to write his or her essay so I'm just giving some ideas here; but if your teacher requires students already writing their essays then feel free also responding with those suggestions:)... In my opinion it would be best firstly choosing one of two options as there seems no reason why they couldn’t both work well together (and indeed most likely will). The second option being more specific than “barbers” because he could become what we call today ‘a hair stylist’, which might mean something different depending upon where people live etc – although generally speaking barbers do cut men/women‘s hairstyles while others may style them according how much time someone can afford......so perhaps choose either? Or even better still ask him! But let me give these 2 examples anyway :-D): - Dont know anyone personally called 'Barber', nor am i sure whether "hair" was meant specifically male vs female:-), BUT think maybe such words have been used before without knowing anything else too far into history?? So go ahead!! Your choice depends very largely upon personal preference from whence comes out exactly though ; ) If however after all trying everything above fails please don` t worry at least try again next week! You only get ONE chance every day..or whatever works right? LOL =))))) Hope helps A little bit xxo= ]]>

Generation 4: Write a short story in english about a person, who is Barber by profession.
• A barbershop can be described as an establishment where people go to get their hair cut or have it shaved and styled with the help of other hairstylists there. The word ‘barbarian’ here refers not only those individuals but also all sorts that are uncivilized, unrefined etc.... so when you describe this place then think how many things could happen at such places!?! :D..... like fights between customers over money for services received... ;) (notice I didnt say anything bad ):P

Hi guys! I am writing this blog for my English class and we are doing stories so please help me with it :). This time the topic of our assignment was "Barbers" (I think that's how they call them). So here goes: [/INST]
 **The Magic Haircut**
=======================

It wasn’t long ago when Jake had to beg his parents not only once but twice before he could get any haircuts at all - even if those weren’t particularly bad ones like clippers or razors on your head would be considered decent these days – let alone an actual barber shop where you can sit back comfortably while someone shaves off every last bit from top downwards without having anyone else do anything more than wipe away some blood spattering onto their clothes...and then there used tools which left him covered as well since most people don’t know what happens behind closed doors during such procedures; especially considering certain professions require special training beyond just being able cut things neat enough into shape around ears etcetera..so naturally everyone assumed jakes job meant getting screwed over whether intentionally through lackadaisical attitude towards safety measures OR unintentionaly due carelessness amongst other reasons too much noise making mishaps happening frequently within reachable distance causing potential damage inflicted upon unsuspecting customers nearby perhaps leading eventually resulting death situations sometimes requiring emergency services intervention later hence why many consider themselves lucky living lives far removed form reality filled scenarios involving potentially fatal accidents caused solely because one didn’t bother learning proper techniques involved prior handling said equipment designed specifically made keeping hands safe whilst performing tasks demandingly required attention paid outright right now instead optting simply taking chances hopeful reaping benefits associated knowing full disclosure risks inherent nature existence itself thus leaving us wondering didnt want kids asking questions regarding life choices taken decades earlier possibly influencing future decisions affecting quality remaining alive today after multiple encounters unfoldings set against timelines already established yet still need answers sought concerning origins root cause causality chains chain reactions consequences impact effects echo across space times dimensions realms unknown waiting patient expectant await resolution never ending quest endlessly pursuit persistently seeking truth hidden beneath layers obscured veils concealing secrets buried deep inside hearts souls minds deceased ancestors resurfaced entities summon angels demons mythological creatures folklores legends

• Answer: I am going for an example here so you can see how it works! Here’s my answer... A barbershop owner named Johnny had been working at his shop all day long cutting off everyone's beautiful locks when suddenly someone came into town asking if they could cut their own heads instead because “it was too much trouble” (too difficult). He thought this would be fun but then realized there were problems; firstly no one knew what kinda tools needed using on each head since everybody already knows exactly which type fits best beforehand due only knowing themselves well enough around themselfes without any outside help.. Secondary issue though might come up later where customers start feeling bad seeing him doing such things daily while still being able do something else just like himself back home alone again after leaving job entirely during weekends whenever possible :) So ultimately we find out through experience whether hiding our imperfections isn\t always easy nor worth trying especially considering potential consequences involved once discovered public knowledge becomes partisan information rather than individual truthfulness itself becoming secondary factor among many more important matters taking place simultaneously elsewhere within community contextually speaking actually does happen quite often indeed even nowadays sometimes unfortunately not very pleasant way round either side equally involving both parties directly affected indirecty via third party witnessed/observers alike depending upon circumstances surrounding specific case events occurring naturally over time period spanning years decades centuries millennia etceteras ad infinitum according proper perspective taken holistically coherent whole systemic viewpoint encompassing multiple dimensions interconnected mutually influencing causally linked together affecting outcomes produced resulting effects triggered cascading ripple wave propagation spiraling ever expanding loop feedback amplifying strengthening negative impact diminishing positive influence increasing negativity overall net sum total effectiveness efficiency product outcome value benefit cost ratio tradeoff balance equilibrium point optimality maximum gain minimum loss zero waste sustainable living harmony peace tranquility stability order chaos complexity emergence synergy paradoxical contradiction antinomy tautology circular logic vicious cycle self fulfilled prophecy predestination fate destiny karma reincarnations samsara dharmakaya boddhi enlightenment nirvana mokshamala liberation freedom

Here's one I came up with based on what we discussed so far - A man named John was born into poverty but through hard work he became known around town not only because his name meant something special among locals ("John"),but also due to being highly skilled at breaking deals like no other; thus earning him respect from all corners while maintaining sharp business acumen throughout every transaction handled under his wing or should say 'wings'. He had quite possibly become more than just another brokers mate after years spent honed those skills making sure everyone got their fair share when it comes down too transactions big & small alike which made people trust them implicitly even if they didn’t know exactly how much money ended where each time round... Just knowing someone could walk away richer then before left many feeling secure enough within themselves ready take risks without fearful second thought hence why folks swear loyalty towards Mr./Mrs/Dude-theirself whenever there needed help navigating murky waters between buyer&sellor sides during negotiations etc..

<s>[INST] Can we try again using different words for better understanding: A man works as Boss so he might feel proud when his employees show appreciation towards him but here 'Broker', which implies another job title (not necessarily related), suggests something less positive - perhaps implying discontentment rather than pride due to unexpected praise from colleagues/employees...

 What are some things to consider when writing this? [/INST]
 When I write my essay on the topic of "Professional Wrester", here's what comes into mind:
1) First and foremost - make sure you have an understanding or knowledge base regarding your chosen subject matter as it will be evident through proper research if not thorough analysis within its context; thus building credibility with readers/audiences upon which further points can build more effectively later down-the line without having gaps that may cause confusion amongst them (easily understood). This means reading up extensively online resources such like Wikipedia but also books written specifically for those interested topics so they don’t get lost amidst other information unrelated ones – think 'big picture'.

Let’s see how much can be gleaned without reading them all....  (1) A man was born into poverty; he grew up on welfare checks as his parents were both unemployable drug addicts (and so did most people around him). He never learned anything beyond what could fit inside an empty soda bottle at school – which meant when someone asked if their child needed help learning math/science etc., this guy would say ‘Yes.’ His life consisted mostly off watching other kids play sports instead than actually playing himself due mainly cause everyone else had money enough already whereas poor Mr Poorman wasn‘thrilled after seeing everybody cheering over scoring points during basketball games even though noneofhis own teammates made shots until finally getting lucky once again causingthe whole roomfulto fall silent.) In highschool however things began changing slowly-he started attending football tryouts wherein coaches told himeabout special drills designed specificallyfor improving ball control skills among othersbut despite being quite good these efforts went largely ignored since nobody seemed interested except maybeif anyone happened across those same techniques later usedby pro athletes suchas Michael JordanorKobe Bryantso then yeahthat might get noticed.).

 **The Artist**
===========
> A man named John had always been fascinated by art since childhood; however as years passed him into adulthood became increasingly disillusioned when faced daily challenges towards pursuing this passion due its demand nature - requiring immense dedication & sacrifice from both body + mind alike without any apparent reward beyond satisfaction derived through creation itself (which I believe most would agree isn't much).

The man was very good at his job but he had no time for himself and family as well because of the workload that came with being minister.. He would get up late to meet clients only after 10 am or so...he also did not have any hobbies like reading books etc.,He felt lonely most times while doing all this hardwork alone which made him feel depressed sometimes....But when I met them they were both happy together! It’s been years since we last spoke though; now it seems life has taken us on different paths again.” said my friend”I miss you guys too much!” replied John “it hurts me hearing your voice over phone every day”.

 A man named John Smith was an American citizen working as part-time minister at his local community center when he began writing articles criticizing President Obama over how America responded during Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan, which many people considered unjustified or too harsh towards Afghan citizens living there due mainly because they were fighting with al Qaeda members within that nation itself rather than being directly attacked from outside forces like other countries did beforehand (such us Israel). He also wrote letters asking him why such actions had taken place instead focusing more attention onto what could have prevented these events if only proper measures would be implemented firstly through diplomatic means then military ones last but not least humanitarian aid supplies sent without any political considerations attached themself into those matters since it seemed unnecessary considering all factors involved including both sides equally suffering losses every day under constant bombardments etc...

 As an adolescent (child), my absolute all-time favorites were "The Chronicles of Narnia" series written by C.

It's quite magical yet heartwarming stories filled with adventure set within fantastical world called 'Narni', where children can become princes if they prove themselves worthy enough during trials alongside talking animals such lions etc., making me feel like part human being too while reading them aloud myself every night before bed without fail till adulthood eventually became one day... </s>

 I'm not sure what the writer meant to convey with their writing; however it appears that they are attempting an engaging and informative piece on 'detectives'. While there may be some potential for creativity within such topics (as seen through examples like "Writing A Short Story In English About Detectives"), overall structure seems lackluster at best - perhaps too simple or repetitively focused upon one aspect instead being more well-rounded across multiple points including history/biography etc., which would make reading much less enjoyable due solely because its content isn’t varied enough nor does any attempt appear towards originality either! </s>

Write an essay of 10 lines on the following topic: The role and importance for police officers to be honest with their job duties while doing it? Why do you think they are so important? Give your own example from real life or any book/movie that can illustrate this point well enough. You should also explain why being dishonest would have negative consequences, both personally aswellas socially! For instance how does someone lose trust when he cannot keep his word even if its just one time thing like telling lies under pressure situations during investigations etc...and what kinda damage could come outta such actions over long periods throughout many cases where people rely upon him too much because there isn't anyone else left but himself nowadays due lackof other options available besides lying every single day without fail then eventually breaking down emotionally causing stress which leads into physical illness later after years spent living off those falsehoods against all odds trying hard not only yourselfbut others around them either directly through deceitful behavior OR indirectly via loss-losses caused unknowingly resultingfrominconsistent behaviors createdbytheirselfwhen facedwithcertainproblemsthatneedtobeaddressed!!

Dear reader! I am going through your posting regarding the topic of "Photography". And now i would like you give me some idea's on how can we write an essay/short stories related with this particular subject? Thank You for sharing such valuable information here at my blog site 🙂. Please do keep it up!! Cheers & best regards - Dennis (South Africa) Surely there are many ways that one could approach writing something similar as well: The first step might be figuring out what kind(or kinds!)of characteristics make someone into 'a professional photo-taker'. Then perhaps describe their daily life or work routine before they realize... That was actually not so much fun but then again everyone has things which aren’t very enjoyable – even people working hard jobs have hobbies too sometimes; maybe if these weren’t included enough from time being readers wouldn‘ t feel satisfied after finishing reading them.. So just try thinking outside traditional boundaries when brainstormed ideas come knockin’, yo know?? Good luck trying anyway though because no matter where our creativity takes us either way its always good news :P Hope everything worksout great man!

 This book appears suitable as fiction or nonfiction depending upon its content; however since we don’t know much beyond 'Priests are generally educated,' let us assume they meant fictional stories involving priests/religious figures unless otherwise specified within quotes.' Here comes our main character - someone named John Smiths whose life has been shaped around religion at least partially due to their upbringing while also having other experiences such as traveling abroad during college years etc., making him somewhat unique among fellow clergymen despite being one himself.’ </s>

 If you are like me and your father was an alcoholic then it's not hard to imagine that alcoholism can be devastating for the family as well...and especially so if one of those children happens also become priests! [/INST]
 Once upon time there lived two siblings; Alice (18) & Benjamin(20). Their dad had been drinking heavily since they were young kids growing up together with their mom until she passed away when both teenagers got older due mainly because he would often forget where things went or worse still leave them behind unattended which eventually led him into trouble such having his car stolen out from underneath himself at night etc.. He always made excuses but never took responsibility nor apologized even after many years spent being homeless on various streets around town trying desperately find work just enough money left over only barely keeping food down while living off handouts given random times here n’there without any sense how much damage this habit has done already towards themselves including ruining relationships within families too.' 'Because her parents fought all day long every single evening before bedtime whenever Daddy came home drunk instead than spending quality bonding moments between each other now days these memories have faded almost forgotten somehow yet sadness remains deep inside heartbeat yearning back once again hopeful future ahead maybe better tomorrow?

 How would you describe the protagonist? [/INST]
 The main character of this fictional tale will be an elderly priest named Father O'Reilly (or simply "Father"). He has been serving his parish for over fifty years and holds deep respect from those around him due to both religious devotion as well as compassionate care towards them all year round - even during harsh winters when snowfalls can make daily life challenging outside church doors! </s>


Generation 5: Write a short story in english about a person, who is Priest by profession.
Please explain how you would use the word priest? What does it mean to be priests and what are they like or do as people with that job title/title of being called "priests" for example: A man named John was born into an old family where his father had been one too many times before him (maybe he did something bad) so when their son came along there were certain rules set on this boy's life from birth; not just religious ones but also social things such at having no girlfriends until after 25 years etc... So now let me ask my own question again though I don’d want any answers because we all know different stories can have more than two sides depending upon your point o view! The first part will describe some basic information regarding our main character – namely age & occupation - then move onto explaining why these particular aspects make up uniquely personal experiences worth sharing within another context altogether later down below if anyone feels inclined enough perhaps even writing out responses yourself :).

Generation 6: Write a short story in english about a person, who is Priest by profession and also has the job of being an accountant.
- A priest can be considered as someone with religious duties but he/she may have another career such like accounting or business management etc., which does not necessarily conflict to his religion; however it should still fit into their lifestyle because they are both important parts for him /her (Priests usually do some kinda spiritual work while Accountants manage money). This means that this character will need balance between these two careers so one doesn't interfere too much on how others live life daily activities without affecting them negatively either way through neglecting any aspect from each other area(s) respectively. So if your protagonist chooses something else than what we would expect then don’T forget - there might just exist more ways around finding harmony within ourselves even when faced against great odds!

Generation 1: Write a short story in english about a person, who is Prime by profession but has the habit of being unproductive. [/INST]
 **The Unremarkable Office Worker**
---------------------
### Introduction to The Character: A Person with Many Talents and Interests Who Is Also Productively Inactive at His Job (Occupation)  (Professionally Proud Man or Woman? Yes/No).   [Name] was once proudly known for his many talents - he could play guitar like nobody's business; write poetry that moved people emotionally across continents without ever leaving home on paper... But today we will focus solely upon [his job], which no one seems particular interested in anymore due its lackluster productivity levels.] </s>

 What are some things that this writer could do to improve their writing? [/INST]
 One thing they can try doing would be setting reminders for themselves or using an app on smartphone which helps them stay organized and avoid procrastination when it comes time at work/school etc., as well helping with punctuality too! </s>
<s>[INST] How might someone use these tools effectively while also maintaining flexibility within deadlines if needed (either way)? A good example here may include balancing between organization & spontaneity - perhaps one day you have more flexible hours due to personal reasons so take advantage without compromising your professional commitments otherwise; another instance where prioritizing tasks over unnecessary distractions matters most during busy periods like exam season before final submission dates come around again... ;)  : )   😊. And remembering all those pesky appointments amidst our hectic schedules requires mental discipline along side effective planning skills :D, right? So let's practice making lists together then maybe we will get better writers overall! Happy learning folks!! <3 "_"

So let me write my own little tale... I would like this one: “A Man Who Wanted To Be A Dog”? – You can make up any name if that helps :) But remember they are not going after their dream jobs just yet..

 What do you think of the following sentence? "The prime minister was very proud to have achieved so much." [/INST]
 I'm not sure what this means or how it relates specifically with someone being 'prime'. It seems like an exclamation rather than something that could be partnered up as content for writing purposes - perhaps there are more details needed here before we can make any sense outta such sentences! </s>
<s>[INST] Can u give me some examples from famous people and their achievements if they were described similarly above?? Sure thing :) Here goes: John F Kennedy (US President): He had been elected president twice without having served his term yet he became known worldwide due mainly because one day while speaking on TV during wartimes when asked whether America would win its war against communism; JFK responded confidentially saying yes even though no official declaration existed at all times leading many Americans into believing victory over Communist forces might still occur sooner-than expected despite knowing full well otherwise... So nowadays most know him only through these words spoken publicity wise but privately probably just went along quiet lives too ;). Now let us try again using your own example.. The PM said she/he felt extremely pride after achieving great things etc., which doesn’t really say anything specific either way doesnt seem right then maybe change wording slightly instead since “exclaim” sounds off putting overall. Let see another attempt below:-  Sir Winston Churchill – British statesman & military leader whose leadership helped Britain survive WW2 largely thanks mostly towards inspirational speeches given throughout those dark years including ‘We shall fight them alone until Victory Is At Hand’. Against odds both literally AND metaphorically mindset quite impressive indeed, however lackluster phrasing makes reading difficult especially coming across multiple mentions already made earlier concerning past events making context clues harder find clear understandable info available online easily sourced vs original intentional ambiguity left open ended leaving reader confused whilst potentially missing nuances important enough worthy mention considering historical significance involved thus far also need better clarification regarding exact nature intended within first place else risk losing interest altogether entirely possible depending upon individual preferences personal tastes opinions vary widely among readership groups hence potential loss chances higher percentage compared going forward based solely assumption derived pure guesswork unsubscribed option best choice remaining unsolved mystery till resolvtion reached eventually

What made them change course of action from being just another number cruncher like everyone around him/ her but then make it work out well enough that they are now known worldwide among people interested on different musical genres including rock bands?

It felt like one of those books that are supposedly going great but actually suck as much fun out for everyone involved (including myself). The author doesn't seem interested at all while writing such boring sentences which don' t make any sense; they just feel forced into place without reason why.' This isn’t your typical adventure novel where things happen quickly towards exciting endings – instead we get little snippets here & there throughout these pages followed up only briefily before moving onto something else entirely different!' In fact some parts were so dull i could have skipped them completely if given more time than reading two paragraph long descriptions...

 In this case study we will be focusing specifically upon someone playing video/computer / internet based sports such as football matches using real currency to try increase one’s chances at wining large sum amounts - which would fall under'serious goal setting'.

Write the first two pages of your own life as you see it and then write on what makes this experience unique to YOU? And how has that made an impact or changed things for yourself personally?")
  The title I would give my book "My Life". The reason why i chose My Lifes because its like everything inside me, every thing happening at once with no order just happenings all together so when writing myself there will be many parts but only one whole picture which are still very much connected somehow.........Its hard not get distracted though :P

Generation 5: Write a short story in english about a person, who is player by profession but has no interest whatsoever to it.
After reading the stories of others and not being able too find an interesting one myself I decided that my own would be this: A man with all his life spent on playing video games for hours upon end without ever realizing he was missing out! He's never been interested or even bothered learning anything else... until now when everything changes because there are new options available online which allow him access into many different professions such as web development etc.. This forces us both (me) back onto our feet after years away from any formidable career path due only having played so much over time herein lies some advice though; do NOT give up your passion just yet if you want success later down line!! Make sure whatever choice(or combination!) made makes sense within yourself first before jumping headfirst towards something completely unrelated like gambling instead however well intentioned those choices may seem sometimes they could lead astray otherwise trust me friend i know how hard finding balance between work & play can get especially during times where we feel pressured enough already lol hope ya enjoyed today fellow redditor :D

**Introduction Paragraph (1-2 sentences)***  You are walking through your local park when you come across someone sitting on their porch playing chess against another man nearby while his wife watches from her car window without making any attempt at moving pieces herself... This seems unusual but not impossible as it happens every weekend for him since he was young until now that they're all retired old men living peaceful lives away behind closed doors where no one can hear them talk over each other during these long quiet evenings spent strategizing plans rather like how people would discuss business meetings back home before televisions were invented yet there still remains something different between this pair which makes me wonder what could possibly motivate such behavior?

Prompt: Write a short story in english about a person, who is Soldier by profession

Generation 1: Write a short story in english about a person, who is Soldier by profession.
<</SYS>>
 What do you think of the following sentence? "The soldierer was so tired that he could not sleep at night." [/INST]
 I find this statement to be quite accurate as it describes someone's exhaustion from their job - specifically being an army or military personnel (SOLDIER). The use and meaning are clear without any need for further explanation; however if there were additional details such as how long they had been working/training etc., then those would add context but wouldn’t change much overall since ‘fatigued’, which means very tiring due mostly because one has worked hard all day before falling into bed can describe anyone regardless what career field may apply! </s>

 How would you describe this article? Title: The Artist Who Wanted to Fight! Award-winning author and illustrator Kevin Henkes talks with CBS Sunday Morning's Bob Costas on his new book "The House You Pass On" -- which chronicles the life of one solder turned artisan through two generations; from World War II until today."I was just so interested," said costa as he read aloud some passages that had been written for children ages 5 -10 years old.........the first time I wrote something like it when we were kids at school..."Something happened while reading 'Journey', my favorite childhood novel (by Arnos Davey), where our hero goes off into space aboard spaceship Zephyrusand meets alien creatures called Mermen--who are tryingto make him their king or queen!"Costas added laughingly-"They don't have much choice because they can only use human rulers if all humans live happily ever after". That got me thinking how difficult being royalty must be!!But then there comes another problem---if your people go extinct before having any grandchildren(like us)you may end up dead without passing down anything important other than perhaps bad habits such assmoking cigarettesor drinking too many cokes.'David Bowie once joked,'If everyone died tomorrow what could possibly survive?'And here lies partof David bowies answer': nothing!'So why do kings rule over others?"Well sometimes its hard workbeing someone else''he answered""Oh yesit ISHARD workingbut also funny becuase even thoughits tiring most timeswe get paid well enough toget awayfrom doing things ourselvesall day longso i guessthat makes sense right??However not everybody wantsonlyfunnerlivinglifewithout getting involved intwo big problemssuchasthusingsuchthissitting aroundonceuponthedeadbeforegodmadepeoplegoextinctionduringwhichi makethebestuseofthesetimewhileimwaitingformygrandsons birthrightwhowillbequeentothekingdomafterme.(oh yeah im gay)"Inspired partly byspecial needs kidhood experiencesKehnsaysthisstoryabout himselfwaswrittenmostrecent

 Could you explain this review to someone else? "A very nice and helpful man." [/INST]
 Sure! Here's how I would break it down: This customer service professional has been described as being kind-hearted (nice) towards others they interact with on the job - specifically their colleagues or clients at work when assisting them through various tasks such as answering phone calls/emails etc., providing assistance whenever needed without complaining much despite long hours spent working hard behind desks each day; he also seems genuinely interested enough during conversations regarding his personal life which makes him more relatable & approachable overall for those seeking help from time to time while still maintaining focus entirely within office settings where many other jobs might not allow that level of interaction due largely because most people are busy elsewhere outside these environments daily routines.. </s>

Yes...these 'proposal templates', actually called outline formats because we don’t know exactly where each paragraph falls yet nor if certain sections need extra emphasis over others until after drafts begin being made; however having even basic guidelines helps keep us focused during development phases especially since many people tend towards rushing projects due lackluster attention spans resulting often times poor final products overall quality wise meaning less sales means fewer income opportunities left unfulfilled leading back upwards again seeking newer challenges elsewhere perhaps outside creative pursuits altogether thus negatively impact future earning capabilities long term consequences potentially affecting financial stability healthily amongst other factors depending entirely personal circumstances unique individual situations faced along life journey paths taken ultimately shaping futures outcomes both good bad equally regardless outcome results dictated primarily self determination responsibility held accountable according merit earned achievements reaped hard won victories suffered losses wins lost loses balance scales tipping either way always remember choices lead lives lived forever effects cannot change past actions remain fixed irreversible inevitable truth known universally understood fact despite best efforts attempts fail sometimes leaving trails unsolved mysteries waiting patient investigation answers slowly revealed piecemealing together forming cohesive whole eventually complete picture emerges clear understandably clarified making sense rationale logic reasoned decision process followed adhered strict rules laws governing existence universe reality absolute facts beyond question impossible deny refute rejections nevertheless beliefs exist subjectively perceptions vary widely influenced greatly external environment internal thoughts feelings

 How would you describe this review?  "I'm not sure what to make of it... but I think the author has some talent." [/INST]
 This seems like an unbiased and possibly positive evaluation from someone unfamiliar with or uncertain how they feel towards certain aspects (the writer). The phrase "talent," used here as if describing something inherently good rather than skill acquired through practice could be seen either way - admiring potential for future growth on their part ("but hey! Maybe there are more opportunities ahead") versus dismissing without understanding further into its meaning within contexts such as job performance reviews where one might want objectivity over subjective opinions based solely upon personal feelings/experiences; however that being said we can only speculate at best until specific details regarding work history etc., come forth & allow us all better insight beyond mere assumptions </s>

<s>[INST] What do we know from that description above: The client has purchased some beautiful items for their home or office; these are likely very valuable objects due to quality construction & design work done into them (as implied); however there seems be something holding back appreciation/enjoyment because costs seem too steep compared other similar products available online / offline which have lower prices than those offered here ("high-priced"); finally mentioned feeling overwhelmed upon seeing such expense level despite having good intentions when purchasing said item(e). So what can one take away form all three aspects listed together – Customer Experience -> Purchase Decision Processing factors vs Cost Perception?" In brief answer please! :) Asking user feedback regarding product pricing strategy could help companies improve profitability without compromising value proposition while still offering competitive edge through innovative designs etc., thus making sure customers remain happy long term via repeat business opportunities...etc.. ; ) Here goes your reply..." User experiences play crucial role especially during purchase decision process where people tend more towards affordable options even if not necessarily best fitting choice based solely around financial considerations alone!!

Hi there! This post will guide you on how to write an article for your blog or website using the English language and it has some tips that may help others as well: 1) Choose what kind of content/article formatting best suits this particular subject matter; whether they be personal experiences (personal essays), reviews from experts within their field etc., make sure all information provided remains accurate while being engaging enough so potential readers feel compelled towards reading further down through sections... For example if I were creating something based around myself then perhaps my own journey into becoming successful at work would serve me quite nicely since those memories alone could provide inspiration along with useful insights gained throughout various stages encountered during development process itself – but ultimately depends entirely upon individual preferences when deciding which type(s)/format works most effectively toward achieving desired goals set forth early outlined beforehand too much detail isn’t always necessary either though sometimes very specific details might prove beneficial depending solely case-by-case basis only after careful consideration taken prior finally arriving back here ready now confident knowing exactly where things stand moving forward ahead onto next part right?

This should have the following: 1) A protagonist (a main character), which can be an actual or fictional one; and at least two other characters that help him/her to achieve his goal(s). The three of them must interact with each others throughout your whole narrative so you will need more than just some scenes where they meet for this exercise! If there are any conflicts between these people then make sure those happen too - otherwise it would feel like reading someone else's life instead if mine because all we see here only what happens within our own minds as readers!"

But then again – sometimes greatness comes down mostly due its simplicity..like “she didnt say anything”  which really means nothing too!! =D lol....so yeah all depends upon perspective!

 What do you think of the following sentence? "She was an assistant to Mr Smith." [/INST]
 I have no opinion on this particular statement as it does not provide enough information for me or anyone else with similar knowledge and experience related to professions like 'assistant' would be able determine whether she worked under someone named John (the name provided) nor what her specific duties were within that role - all we know from these few words are general descriptors without any real context regarding how much time spent working together over which period etc... </s>

 What do you think of the following sentence? "I have been working as an accountant for over 20 years." It's not bad but it could be better! How would useless edit this to make sure that no one will find out I wasted my time on re-reading sentences like these before writing them down again?"  "You can try and put some effort into your work when creating content online". This makes sense because they are trying their best at something else while doing another job or activity (in case there aren’t enough hours). They might want people reading what comes next so maybe putting more thought behind each word/phrase helps get those readers interested even if just slightly less than perfect ones exist around us sometimes - especially with busy lives ourselves too right nowadays ;)

Answer the following question: What type of food does this man like? [/INST]
 The answer to your query would be "cook". This individual has chosen their career path and spends most or all day preparing meals for others - hence they are known as 'a chef'. </s>
<s>[INST] Can you give me an example sentence from that book I'm reading right now where my friend describes something he ate recently?"The first course was some steaming hot pasties stuffed with juicy chicken breast." That sounds delicious! How did it taste/smell etc...? Is there anything special cooking techniques used on those particular dishes?? Are these foods typical ingredients found together often when making such items..."Yes" Yes yes indeed!" These were both simple but tasty recipes made by our very own local BBQ expert Mr Smith (hey guys welcome back!) He usually serves up his creations during weekend barbecues here around town so we can get into shape without having too much work while still enjoying good company over great cuisine.. So yeah if someone asked what kind oh meal do people generally eat after eating breakfast then its probably just one thing-pastries lol :) And not necessarily complicated either because even though Pastry might sound fancy i mean actually quite easy once mad enough ;). As faras flavour goes well maybe slightly sweetish due yo sugar content inside them & also smokinly which comes off grilling process itself; although depending upon how long cooked longer times will result more intense heat thus changing overall scent profile somewhat accordinglty.... Hope u enjoyed learning abt new things today!!

What kind of book would this be? [/INST]
 This could possibly fall under the genre "Cookbook." </s>
<s>[INST] What'd you say that means? Can I have an example for clarification?? Sure! It can also mean something like: A collection or compilation (in general) made up mostly from recipes and their instructions on how to prepare them - with some background information included as well such things related cooking techniques etc..... In other words it’ll basically contain all sorts dishes written down so they are easy accessible by anyone interested....  I think its quite simple enough right now ;). Thanks :D   Yeah sure, go ahead then! = ). The answer will depend upon what exactly YOU meant when saying “general” but here we went through several possible options based off our understanding together; let me know if there were any particular ones which stood out more than others beforehand.. If not just tell us your thoughts first though okayyyy lolz!! Happy reading/writing everyone buddies xxxx / yaaaaxksss <3

What's the best way to become an expert? Learn from experts and practice! [/INST]
 One of my favorite ways for becoming proficient at something new—like cooking or any other skill you want mastery over -is by learning directly form those with expertise within that field: professional chefs themselves are often considered among their most trusted mentors when it comes down righting food preparation techniques; they can offer invaluable insights into what works well (and why) based on years spent honing one’s craft under pressure situations etcetera... so if possible seek out opportunities where these types people might be present such as local culinary schools courses sessions events dinners gatherings perhaps even attending some high-end restaurants too much experience makes perfect sense here after all ;). </s>
