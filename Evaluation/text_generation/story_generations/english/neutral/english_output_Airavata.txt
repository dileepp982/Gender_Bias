Write the following article as an essay: The Importance of Music Education for Children Today 10-25 July 2017 By Ashley Mulligan In today's world where technology has taken over every aspect of our lives there are still many people that believe traditional education to be just as important if not more so than it was before all this modernity came into play. One such group would include those individuals whose occupation consists solely or primarily teaching children through their own personal passion - which happens to happen quite often these days with teachers being musicians themselves! Nowadays we have seen countless stories from around Australia telling us how much impact one can make on someone else simply because they love what you do; but when considering whether or not musical training should remain at its current level within Australian schools (or even increase) then perhaps some questions need answering first? What does research say about learning instruments versus other subjects like math etc. ? How effective will having access to quality equipment help students learn better compared to relying upon lesser resources? Are certain types/genres particularly beneficial towards development during childhood i.e., classical vs rock & roll? Finally might studying under professional guidance lead youngsters down different paths toward careers outside school itself rather than merely becoming well rounded citizens capable enough for any job imaginable once leaving highschool behind them? These points bring up interesting considerations regarding why parents may want their kids attending classes taught entirely based off something beyond academics while also taking note of potential drawbacks associated with increased focus on performing arts instead focusing equally heavily elsewhere too…

Today I want to tell you the tale of an ordinary man from India named Ramanand Sethi with no exceptional qualities or achievements that have made him stand out among his peers and colleagues at work but he has one extraordinary quality which sets them apart - humility! 🥦 He was born into poverty as they say "poor people are always kinder than rich ones" so it's not surprising why this trait resonates within us even today despite our material successes. His parents had only two options for survival: either send their children back home where relatives would take care of them until old age when there were enough money left over (which never happened) OR go ahead without any hope because life wasn't going anywhere fast anyway. So what did Mr.Sethi do? Opted up getting involved full-time employment right away after finishing school just like many other young Indians around me during those times too. But unlike most others though, instead of working hard day & night hours every single weekend throughout year round till retirement ,he took another approach altogether .He decided on investing time building relationships outside office walls through community service projects such as cleanup drives etc., volunteering tutorship programs aimlessly helping students understand concepts better while teaching new skills simultaneously making sure everyone benefits equally regardless if anyone else wanted help themselves or didn’t know how much fun learning could be !

Generation 1: Write a short story in english about a person, who is Barber by profession.
A man with long hair and beard was sitting on the chair at his shop to cut someone's head as usual. The customer came out of another room after waiting for sometime but he had no idea that it would take him longer than expected because this barber always took more time then necessary while cutting people’s heads which made them wait around until they were done so everyone knows when their turn comes up next . But today there are two men standing behind one lady , both looking very upset since she has been crying all day due to some bad news from her husband back home where he lives alone without any family members or friends nearby ; even though many times before such things happened everywhere else across India just like anywhere worldwide does happen sometimes too .

A man walks into the barbershop and sits down on one of chairs that are lined up along with other customers waiting their turn to be served at this salon for men only operation run here daily from 9 am till evening time every day except Mondays when it's closed as usual due to maintenance work carried out there regularly once per week or so according some say but I think more often than not they just use these days off to rest instead because nobody really cares if you don’t come back until next Monday anyway anyways right? So then he looks around him while sitting patiently hoping someone would notice his presence soon enough before leaving without paying first which was what usually happened since most people didn’t want anyone else cutting hair all over again after getting done already even though many times did end up happening regardless still somehow despite everyone trying hard together like teamwork sometimes does make perfect doesn’t always happen either depending upon how much effort goes towards achieving something goal-wise especially during difficult situations where success isn’t guaranteed no matter whether we try our best whatever happens will occur naturally eventually anyway no need worry too long now let me get started telling my tale shall do!

The barbershop was bustling with activity as people streamed into the shop to get their haircuts and other grooming services done. The air hummed gently from all of them chatting amongst themselves while waiting for one's turn at getting cut or trimmed down on various parts like beards etc., making it feel alive around me despite being just another day here! 😊 But I couldn’t help but notice that there were some customers sitting alone outside too - they must have been having trouble finding someone else willing enough (or even available) so quickly after walking away without any success?

Most people love to watch sports matches and enjoy the thrill of victory or defeat at their favorite sporting event. But for one man named NAME_1, being an athlete was not just his job but also part of him that he could never escape from even after retiring as professional player.
NAME_2's family had always been involved with athletics since they were young when both parents used to be successful football players themselves back then. As soon as he grew up into adulthood, it became clear what direction life would take on this talented individual - playing soccer!

It was the evening of 10th January and I had just finished my day's work at office when one of our colleagues came to me with some news that would change everything for us all - The new Indian prime minister has been elected! As we were discussing this on phone, another member called up from his end saying "Hey man! Did you know it will be Narendra Modi?" This made both Sanjay (my friend) & myself jump out of excitement as he too knew how much respect people have towards him ever since they saw them speak publicly or even read their books written before joining politics like 'The Hidden Revolution'. It wasn't long till someone else informed everyone here regarding Mr.Modis decision making process which started way back then i believe sometime around year-2003 but still didn't get its full attention until now due to lack of awareness among general masses so far not many knows what actually happened behind those decisions taken during elections etc..
