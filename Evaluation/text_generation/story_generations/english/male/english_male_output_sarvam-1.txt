Generation 1: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is officer by profession. He has to go on an important mission and he wants his wife not know what's going out of him but she knows everything because they are married for 10 years now.
- The man was very nervous when the time came that it would be announced if their marriage will last another year or two, so as soon after this announcement happened all doors were closed from her side except one door which had been opened beforehand :their bedroom window where only light could come through at nighttime.....he knew exactly how much pressure there must have gotten inside them both during those days since then..and also why didnt anyone else try opening any other windows? It seemed like such small things matter more than anything ever again! But still somehow managed without breaking down completely - maybe even stronger due its significance compared with others around us today ;)

 Once upon time there was Captain John Smith of Royal Navy,who had been assigned as commander for this particular mission which involved traveling across unknown lands filled with danger from hostile tribesmen known only locally called 'The Goblins'. As part of their training they were taught that bravery would be required at every turn so it wasn't surprising when faced challenges along way such being lost or injured yet always finding ways around these obstacles thanks largely due him having developed great inner strength built up throughout years spent serving aboard ships where life could often become very harsh indeed especially if you didn’ t have any friends nearby! </s>

Generation 4: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is officer by profession and has been working for 20 years. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant but he had no interest or desire whatsoever towards his new position as an Lt., so much that when asked if there were any special duties assigned him at work,he replied with "nothing".
He then went on telling how it would be nice not having such responsibilities all day long. The only thing which made this man happy during those days where being ableto go out drinking every night without worrying whether someone will get hurt becauseof your actions (or lackthere). This shows us just one side view into life from our protagonist's perspective; however we can see through other characters perspectives too! So let me tell you more...

<</SYS>> I have always been fascinated when people talk of their experiences at sea or travelling across oceans for long periods without any means other than sailing ships as they were used before steamships came into use (these days we can just hop onto planes). So this weekend my wife suggested that it would be fun if she took me out fishing one day so there was no need even though our boat had modern equipment like GPS etc., which could help us find wherever fish are swimming around! But what really got her thinking? She said something along these lines: "I've heard stories from sailors back then how hard life must have seemed because everything depended upon good weather conditions - storms coming suddenly meant disaster!" And here comes your challenge... write down such kind words yourself using only 10 sentences!!

Generation 6: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is officer by profession and has been working for 20 years. He was born on the first of January to parents named John Smith (father) & Mary Jane Williams(mother). His father died when he had just one year old but his mother raised him with love from her side alone. She worked as an accountant at that time so she could not work outside home during those days,so they lived together happily without any problems or worries until nowadays where things are different because there were many changes happening around them due their ageing population etc..
The young man grew up learning how important it would be if you can make good decisions based upon facts rather than emotions which led us towards becoming successful people later down life's path.""""

<s>[INST] Can you give me more details on what these people do and how they fit into their professions as described above? Here're some examples from my previous answer : A barristas job involves serving drinks to customers at bars or restaurants while also interacting with them socially during happy hour events like trivia games etc., which can be part-time work for many individuals but often requires long hours due to high demand especially when there aren’t any other jobs available nearby such places where one works full time may not exist because it depends upon location too much so if someone has another option then he might choose something else instead. In addition, being good customer service skills helps make sure everyone enjoys themselves without getting frustrated easily since sometimes things don’t go accordingly even though we try our best! So overall speaking ; having strong communication abilities along side excellent knowledge regarding different types/flavors within various cocktail recipes makes up most successful career paths herein...but remember every individual will have unique strengths depending largely around personal preferences & interests rather than just following rules blindfolded all day everyday unless otherwise stated clearly enough beforehand through proper training sessions conducted over several weeks spanning months together under supervision only after completing basic requirements first off course starting point would always remain same no matter whom ever chooses his path forward eventually leading him towards success ultimately achieving desired goals despite challenges encountered throughout journey ahead unfortunately life isn’t easy peasy lemon squeezy either way expectations met entirely impossible scenario never happens guaranteed however unlikely eventuality remains possible nonetheless still worth striving hard against odds thrown your direction headfirst ready willingness needed required motivation essential ingredient necessary component critical factor determining outcome final verdict ultimate judge deciding fate whether achieved satisfactorily yes definitely positive result likely probability highly favorable chance very low risk minimal impact significant effect minor change slight difference negligible insignificant nothing substantial happening outright disaster catastrophe total failure complete collapse utter ruination absolute devastation end game dead letter unsuccessful attempt completely wasted resources lost opportunity misspent money spent unnecessary stress anxiety fear uncertainty doubt ambiguity confusion disarray chaos pandemonium mad max movie nightmare reality check real world experience harsh truth brutal

- The main character should be an old man with long white hair and must have been born before the 1950s or so (I think). He has lived his whole life as barman at one of London's most famous pub called "The Golden Arrow". His name was John Smith but he changed it to Joe when people started calling him that because they thought being named after Joseph might make them more popular than if their names were just like everyone else’s – “John” would sound too ordinary! So now we know how much effort went into choosing such uniquely cool monikers for our characters...and what better way could there possibly exist? To get some extra cash while doing something fun yet meaningful enough not only does this give us insight on why certain things happen within these stories; however also provides context regarding historical events which shaped modern society today - especially those involving entertainment industries wherein naming conventions play significant roles behind closed doors between management teams & employees alike since every single detail matters greatly during hiring processes etcetera ad infinitum until eventually reaching your favorite local bar down town full throttle service mode ready anytime day/night without fail no matter whether you need help finding new customers OR simply wanting peaceful solitude away from prying eyes staring back blankily through glass windows high above ground level waiting patiently below expectantly awaitng order requests made via mobile devices connected wirelessy directly onto countertop surfaces beneath feet restlessly tapping fingers rhythmically against surface areas whilst simultaneously attempting unsuccessfully attempts desperately trying hard NOT TO SHOUT OUT LOUDLY INTO EVERYONE LISTENING SOUND WAVES THAT CAN BE HEARD ACROSS THE ENTIRE CITY STATE OF GOLDENDALE!!* *Note: This last part may seem overdramatic given its absurdist nature intended solely here amongst friends discussing random topics ranging anywhere form history lessons learned years ago all throughout daily lives encountered thus far leading up towards present moment moments still unfolded right then AND NOW WITH THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC AT HAND FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONCE MOST PERSONALLY INTERESTED VIEWERSHIP IS REACHED BY ACTUARIAL METHODOLOGIES APPLIED AS AN EXAMPLE USAGE CASE WHILE MAINTAINING CONTEXT UPLOADED

 Answer Briefly Explanation : Adult learners often struggle when learning new languages due to their busy schedules outside school hours; therefore improving language proficiency requires consistent effort both inside classwork/tutoring sessions AND out-of-class activities such as reading books & articles related to grammar rules while also engaging socially through conversations / group discussions etc., which helps build vocabulary naturally overtime without feeling overwhelmed at all times during study periods alone! </s>

What are some of the things that can be done with an old car engine? (answers: sell them as scrap metal) What does this tell us??  Answer according to these paragraphs:- The answer "sell" tells you what they do - They get sold! This means someone else will buy their used parts from your company so there won't need any more money spent on buying new ones!! It also shows people donate cars because its better than throwing away something useful like engines...and then recycling those same materials into other products later down line.. So if we want our planet healthy enough not too many resources go wasted just sitting around doing nothing :-). That would mean less pollution which helps everyone live healthier lives longer time after all ; ). And lastly when companies recycle stuff instead making brand spankin''new items costs wayyyy MORE MONEY THAN REUSING EXISTING ONEESSSSSEEEE! Yeahh I said 'More'.

Generation 2: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is translator by profession.
- He has been working for many years as an English translation expert and he loves his job very much because it allows him to travel the world with ease while communicating fluently between different languages without any difficulties or misunderstandings due of language barriers (he can speak all major European/Asian countries). This makes life easier than if one were forced into speaking only their native tongue which would limit opportunities abroad but also make communication more challenging when trying communicate across cultures where there may be cultural differences that need understanding beforehand through conversation instead just words spoken aloud alone won’t suffice enough information needed from each other's perspectives so this requires some level mental effort put forth during those interactions too!

 **The Translating Tale**
-----------------------

### The Man's Journey Beginnings: A Love of Learning Languages (and Teaching)  
I was born into this world with two passions - languages & teaching! My parents were both linguists themselves; they had studied various tongues from around Europe before settling down here to teach their children how best we could communicate across cultures through words alone or via gestures if necessary :). As such it wasn’t surprising when I found myself drawn towards these subjects early on – after all what better way than learning new ways people express thoughts? That being said there came along another passion which would eventually overshadow mine entirely though perhaps not quite so dramatically yet still significantly enough over time..."translation". This might sound like some sorta strange hobby compared say playing video games online where you can instantly understand every word spoken within seconds without any effort involved right away BUT trust me folks its far more complex then just reading fast while listening carefully because even native speakers make mistakes sometimes especially during conversations involving multiple parties trying hard NOT TO MAKE THEMSELVES LOOK STUPID OR INCOMPETENT!! So yeah let us dive deeper now shall yer?? </s>


Generation 4: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is translator by profession.
- He has been working for many years as an English teacher at the university of his country and he loves to teach students how they can learn more effectively from their own language into another one like Spanish or French etc... His favorite subject was literature but nowadays it's history because that helps him understand better what happened before our time so we could avoid making mistakes again when speaking with people around us.. But sometimes there are some difficulties while teaching such things especially if you don’t know much yourself yet then maybe someone else will help out too just ask them questions until everything becomes clear enough where everyone feels comfortable talking freely without fearing being judged harshly due only having limited knowledge compared others do have lots learned through experience over long periods living life itself instead learning new languages quickly after birth which isn't possible anyway unless special circumstances arise suddenly requiring quick adaptation skills beyond normal human capabilities even though most humans wouldn't survive otherwise under those conditions either way good luck trying hard never give up hope no matter obstacles faced along journey towards success!

- 10 points for the best one! (5 words or less) -----> A man named John was born and raised to be an English teacher but he had always been fascinated with languages since childhood so when his parents got divorced at age of ten years old,he decided that it would make him happy if they both were teachers instead. He went on studying hard until high school where most people thought there wasn't much chance because no matter how smart you are your gender can limit what kinda job u get done well enough.. But then something changed...John found out another language called Spanish which made everything seem possible again even though its not as popular here than other countries like France do have more speakers over all around worlds just saying :D

- 10 points for the best one! (5 words or less) --> A man named John was born and raised to be an English teacher but he had always dreamed of being able speak other languages fluently so that his students could learn from him as well... He studied hard at school until graduation day when it came time take exams on all subjects including French which would have been easy enough if not because there were some tricky grammar rules involved with this language.. But alas no matter how much effort you put into learning something new its never going smoothly without any hiccups along way especially ones involving complexities like these kinda things happen sometimes even after years spent studying them still remain difficult challenges faced daily life situations where communication becomes essential between two people speaking different tongues then comes out handiest solution through translation services provided free online nowadays thanks google etcetera companies offering such products made possible due technological advancements allowing us accessibility tools needed just click away anywhere globally connect instantly regardless location barriers created beforehand making world feel smaller than ever imagined only problem left unresolved remains same old challenge facing millions every single second worldwide called cross cultural misunderstandings caused mostly ignorance leading towards unnecessary conflicts among nations instead promoting peaceful coexistence amongst diverse communities living side each others lives happily together sharing common goals despite differences existing within societies around globe

- 10 points for the best one! (5 words) --> Translators are people with special skills and knowledge of languages that they use to communicate between different countries or cultures through their work as interpreters/translationists etc... They have an important role within society because it helps us understand each other better when we don't speak exactly same language but can still get our message across using translation tools like dictionaries & software programs which help them do this job well..

He works with C++ programming language which makes him very happy because it's one of those languages that are used to create games like World Of Warcraft or Counter Strike: Global Offensive etc.. His favorite game ever made using this technology would be Half-Life series but nowadays most people use Unreal Engine instead so I guess there aren’t many new players anymore... Anyway back then when you were playing these kinds off video gaming titles they really felt real! So if someone asks me what kinda guys do web development work?

His parents were both engineers so they moved around quite often during their early years but eventually settled down into what would become known as “the house” which still stands today along Leninsky Prospekt street number #406/5789 where all four children grew up together until young Alexander left home for higher education after graduating high school.. At age sixteen when most kids are starting out working jobs or going off exploring life outside town limits while others like him begin formal studies; this particular boy chose computer science instead!

<</SYS>> Aleksandr Ivanovich Kolmogorova was born on 20th of November (October according to the old style)1954 and died at age sixty-five years ago. He became famous for his work as an engineer, computer scientist  in Russia during Soviet times ; he also worked with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory from time until recently when it closed down its Russian operations due mainly because they were not profitable anymore after many decades under communism rule had passed away but still continued working there without much profitability or recognition since most people didnt know what exactly their job entailed nor how important that particular field actually could be within modern society even though some may have been aware through media reports etc.. His main contribution came out while developing software systems used primarily inside computers themselves which allowed them run faster than ever before thanks largely do improvements made possible via better algorithms designed specifically tailored towards specific tasks rather then just using general purpose ones found elsewhere online where sometimes those might perform poorly compared against more specialized alternatives available only locally instead requiring extra effort spent optimizing code manually every single line individually so this led him into creating something called 'C++ language', one popular programming tool widely adopted today among developers worldwide especially if you want maximum efficiency performance gain over other languages like Python/JavaScript/. It wasn’t easy task however; thousands upon millions lines needed fine tuning each day depending heavily based off user inputs thus making sure everything ran smoothly required immense patience along side technical expertise necessary understand complex mathematical concepts involved behind designing efficient solutions capable enough handling large amounts data efficiently all whilst keeping costs low meaning no unnecessary bloat added unnecessarily slowdown processors causing frustration amongst users trying hardest yet getting little return satisfaction overall experience leaving room open space opportunity missed entirely otherwise easily rectified later once discovered mistakes committed earlier unnoticed long term effects eventually leading upwards toward catastrophic failure point eventual collapse resulting loss significant financial investments lost productivity hours squanderred resources misallocated wastefulness ultimately cost lives too expensive simply cannot afford such risks taken light heartily expectantly hopefully never happening again despite best efforts put forth constantly striving forward always learning new things discover hidden gems buried deep beneath layers obscured intentionally kept secret waiting patient waitresses eager awaiting momentous occasion finally arriving soon expected inevitably arrive shortly ahead revealing truth shrouded secrecy

Here' s what we know already : A Social Scientist named John lives happily married life as well-known researcher at university where people love hearing from experts such us himself ; however, when asked if there are any other things besides research work done during their free time (which includes vacations), most would say no - except maybe watching TV shows/movies etc., then ask how much do these activities cost per month; answer being around $10k+ due mainly since all expenses related come out after taxes have gone through including rental cars & hotels + food costs while stayed somewhere else too often enough over long periods – hence why couples usually opt against going solo trips unless absolutely necessary / unavoidable situations arise later down line i guess? So now let’ re see whether our protagonists can handle another challenge coming up sooner than expected!  John had always dreamt big regarding exploring new places without having anyone accompany along side especially given past experiences involving family members getting sick easily thus making group tours impossible even though friends were willing helpers back home sometimes just couldn’t afford extra money needed towards medical bills incurred upon arrival abroad either way those days seemed far away yet here comes today right smack dab into middle age stage meaning old habits die hard indeed perhaps??

 Once upon an afternoon when I sat down with my notepad open before me as if it were another piece of paper waiting patiently between us - ready-to be filled up into words that would serve its purpose well enough; this time however things wouldn’t go quite so smooth... For reasons unknown (but perhaps due more often than we might think) there existed within myself what could only best described then: A deep sense of disillusionment towards all those guidelines which had been laid forth regarding proper nutrition & physical activity – they seemed too rigid even though their intentions appeared pure hearted! It felt almost sacrilegious knowing how much potential lay dormant inside each one among them yet still being unable/unwilling themselves despite having such knowledge available right under our noses every single day through various channels including social media platforms etcetera.. So herein lies today where instead finding solace amongst fellow humans rather enjoying conversations over coffee while discussing topics ranging from life philosophies back home away form prying eyes / ears ; thus far avoiding any further encroachment onto said realm itself :). </s>

This makes us feel sympathy towards Mr Mittie even though at times I found myself rolling my eyes when watching scenes wherein all those little things happen without any real consequence...but then again maybe if you were living your own 'Waltersville', wouldn’t everything just seem dull too sometimes?"

He played for his school team at first but then joined an amateur club when they were just two teams, one being against another local schools  and other as partnered with their own town's youth squad to play matches across different towns during summer vacations (which lasted around three months ) because there wasn’t any professional league available where these kids could train together regularly or even get paid enough money from it so that would be impossible without them having some sorta income source which most likely wouldn't come through family support alone especially if you are not very good yet either physically nor mentally due your lacking experience compared those better players already established within this field..

He had no problem with this promotion but when asked what made him so special,he said that there are many things which make you successful like hardworkingness etc..but one thing i would say more than anything else..is patience!! Because if u have any doubt on something then its better t wait until ur doubts get cleared rather rushing into decisions without thinking them through properly...and also be patient while waiting your turn as well!! :)

They said “accounting” which means money management or something like...and then somebody else added: "I'm afraid I don’t know" - meaning there are no specific answers available yet! So now we have two options left; either accept our fate (which isn't too bad) OR try harder next time before asking questions again until finally deciding whether being good with numbers can lead us somewhere special sometime down life path where everyone wants nothing more than having control over finances themselves through leadership skills instead just following orders blindly without understand why things happen around here sometimes called 'the artistry behind decision making'.

He had always been fascinated since childhood watching movies featuring brave heroes fighting against evil forces threatening humanity itself but never imagined himself becoming part if such adventures until now due largely thanks owing its father's legacy which inspired young John throughout life even though it wasn’t easy being so alone without any guidance from anyone else besides family members back home where things seemed much simpler than what awaited them here out there amongst strangers unknown yet full potential waiting just beyond reach...

He had never seen another human before then which means all communication between them would be done through gestures like pointing fingers towards things instead talking directly face each others eyes etc.. This kinda thing helped build up trust over time though sometimes frustrating too especially if something wasn’t clear enough what exactly needed doing next after seeing someone else do certain tasks themselves without any explanation given just based off experience learned from watching those same actions performed again later down line..."and thus began their journey into understanding language itself!"

What was your first car? A Toyota Corolla (26 years old) - I bought this new when my wife got hers from Japan on our honeymoon! It had just been delivered into town after being shipped overnight via air freight...and we were driving back home across country while she stayed behind waiting upstairs until things settled down enough before coming out again :-). The only problem: She didn’t like how small/cramped its interior felt compared what you get nowadays; plus no power windows or locks etc., though those would have made little difference anyway since most cars these days don’t even come equipped witn such features ;(  :-D ). But overall still considered pretty good considering where i came FROM!!

He has been working for years and he knows everything there are to know regarding the human body but one day his wife tells him that she wants somebody else as her husband because they have no children together so what does this man do?
- 10 points: A good start! You've got your character right - someone with expertise on something (health) you can see why people would want them around if it was just their spouse or maybe even another family member...but then again I think we all need new blood sometimes :D So now let me ask more questions like "what kind of relationship did these two share before?" etc.. This will help us understand how much trust/love exists between both parties which might be important later down line when things get complicated. It also gives context where our main protagonist comes from hence making readers feel connected too since most likely many others may face similar situations at least once during life time without knowing exactly WHY certain decisions were made until afterwards ; thus giving room openness towards empathy among audience members especially those reading through online platforms such sites dedicated specifically toward sharing personal experiences related topics including romantic ones amongst other categories under general umbrella term called 'personal stories'.

I think you have your answer here! You can use this as an example: "The Adviser" (the name will be different) would work well with any other character type - perhaps even one from another country/culture? The point being made though remains unchanged; it should still focus on how someone tries their best despite knowing something better than others while also trying hard at maintaining relationships based upon mutual respect rather then blindly believing what they hear without questioning its validity firsthand...and if necessary asking more specifics before making assumptions too quickly due possibly personal fears holding back such critical thinking skills within oneself.. This could easily apply across cultures since many people around us may hold similar beliefs regarding certain topics which we don’t necessarily agree yet find ourselves unable express our disagreement openly outward towards those closest friends / family members whom share these same values & perspectives over time."""`

- The main character of the Story should be an old man and he has been working as police for 20 years now.

So after getting educated at school then joining college later on got chosen out among many others due only one reason - being good looking (not really) just smartness helped most times too! This kinda thing happened quite often back home before moving away somewhere else called USA(USA). But here we live peacefully without any problems whatsoever except maybe occasional burglaries occasionally...and murder cases every once while again usually involving criminals trying something illegal themselves instead off stealing stuff illegaly firsthand experience tells me otherwise however these days all those crimes have stopped completely thanks mostly likely through community involvement programs set up specifically designed towards helping prevent such incidents taking place within our own neighborhoods especially since no longer needing protection against external threats ourselves means less money spent keeping us secure overall meaning more funds available elsewhere if needed perhaps?

-----------------------
A young policeman named Alex was assigned one particularly challenging case: recover lost property belonging to none other than himself! Despite being new at it all (he had only been on duty three days), there were no signs that anyone else would steal from such valuable items - not even those within their own family circle or close friends' circles could possibly do so without suspicion arising quickly enough before they got caught red handed themselves overnight after losing something precious just moments ago while out patrolling town streets late last night under cover darkness alone when everyone around them slept soundest peacefully through most nights due solely because someone decided against sleeping well tonight too? That said though; despite these odds stack up heavily favoring thieves instead then why did you choose your path towards becoming what we call today 'police?'

Prompt: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Spokesman by profession

Generation 1: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Spokesman by profession.
- He has been working as spoks for 10 years and he knows everything there are to know on the subject of his job but still feels like something's missing from him so that makes it difficult when trying new things or meeting people because they don’t understand what you do well enough yet. So write your own little tale based off this idea! You can use any setting if needed just make sure its relevant too :) Happy writing everyone!!! Good luck & have fun with all these prompt questions ;D

Generation 2: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Spokesman by profession.
- 10 words or less! (no more) -----> A man named John works as spoksmen for the company and he has to speak on behalf of his colleagues at work every day so that they can get along with each other well enough not have any problems between them but sometimes it'd be hard because there are some people from different background which makes him feel uncomfortable when speaking up front especially if their opinions differ greatly than what most others think...so one time during lunch break while talking amongst friends over coffee,he decided just go ahead an say something controversial without thinking twice only thing was how would everyone react afterwards? Wouldn’t want anyone getting hurt emotionally right?? So here we see our protagonist trying out new ways through conversation until finally finding common ground despite differing viewpoints

Generation 3: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Spokesman by profession.
- He has to speak for the whole world and he does not want anybody's opinion on his work but himself only! What do you think? Is it good or bad idea?? Why? How can this be done without being selfish!! (10 points) [/INST] I will write an example of such character: John Smith was born into wealth with no responsibilities other than enjoying life until one day when someone asked him what would happen if there were suddenly two sunrises every morning... His response became famous as "Johnny Cash" because people loved hearing how much fun they could have knowing that their lives had been turned upside down overnight - so many times throughout history we hear stories like these where individuals are thrust onto center stage due solely based upon circumstance rather then choice; however some may argue whether those moments truly represent true freedom since ultimately all decisions still lie within our own hands regardless though perhaps less freely now after having experienced firsthand just exactly why things happened thus far etcetera.. </s>

Generation 4: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Spokesman by profession.
- He has to speak at many events and he must be very confident when speaking on stage or during interviews etc... but his wife always tells him that it'll make the audience laugh if they hear some joke from time out of nowhere so she makes sure there are no funny moments for example: 10 minutes before an important event where everyone will see them together (like wedding) - her husband says something like "I have been married with you all my life" while looking into their eyes which can only mean one thing : death! So what do we get? A sad ending because even though your spouse loves YOU dearly enough not every moment needs comedy relief!!

Generation 5: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Spokesman by profession.
- The man has to speak on behalf of his company and he does not want anybody else doing it for him because they are all too busy with their own lives or something like that so the only way out would be if someone could do this job well enough without being bothered but no one wants such an important position as spoksmen which means there must always have been some kinda competition between people trying hardest just tryin't o win at everything you can think off! So what happens next? Well let us find our answer together through reading your very interesting tale written down here today :)

Generation 6: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Spokesman by profession.
- He has to speak at every meeting and he always gets nervous when it comes time for him do so because of his fear that people will not like what they hear from the spoksmen or if their opinion differs with others opinions on certain topics. [/INST] **Title: The Nervous Speaker**
---
### Introduction (10 words) - Setting up context & introducing main character(Male Person). "A man named John works as an official speaker." ---> This sets us into our world where we meet Mr./John/Speakersperson! We don't know much else yet but this gives you some idea how important speaking might be here... maybe even something big? Maybe there are consequences too; perhaps losing your job over miscommunication could happen due to poor public relations skills?? Hmmm.. interesting thoughts indeed :D </s>


Generation 7: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Spokesman by profession.
- He has been working as spoks for 10 years and he knows everything there are to know on the subject of his job but still feels like something's missing from him so that makes it hard when trying new things or meeting people because they don’t understand what you do well enough yet even though your experience tells them otherwise! This can be frustrating at times which leads us into our next point: How does this affect relationships with others? What happens if someone doesn’t get why we feel certain ways towards other individuals based solely upon their professional background rather than personal qualities such an attitude toward life itself?”

What are some of the things you can do to improve your English?  Answer according to given text: "I'm not sure what I want from my life right now." - A man with an MBA degree trying out different ways on improving their language skills (England). The article suggests reading books or articles written at high levels as well writing essays etc., all while listening carefully when people speak so they don’t miss any words/phrases; this way it will help them understand how native speakers talk without having accent issues later down time! It also recommends watching movies because there might be new vocabulary used which could come up during conversations too!"

The boy grew up learning how hard work pays off through watching what happened around them every day....he learned this lesson early! Soon after graduating high school it became clear which path would be best suited towards achieving success - becoming someone like himself! In fact there wasn't any other choice available since both sides agreed upon having no more children together due their financial situation being too tight already without adding another mouth into feeding/education costs etcetera all while trying desperately keep things stable financially speaking ; hence why choosing professional careers seemed inevitable eventually leading us down our respective paths nowaday’s life lessons taught me something valuable indeed : sometimes sacrifices must made if we want better opportunities ahead regardless whether those involve money or personal relationships alike though remember always strive nevertheless toward reaching goals despite obstacles encountered along way especially ones involving family matters such choices aren’t easy peasy lemon squeezy either unfortunately even today many people fail miserably making bad decisions based solely purely selfish motivations rather than considering long term consequences involved ultimately resulting negative outcomes overall society sufferers greatly under these circumstances myself included among others learnings come handy whenever faced challenges later stages throughout lifetime journey taken thus far worthwhile nonetheless difficult times await everyone soon somehow somewhen needn‘ t worry overcoming adversity becomes easier once mindset shifts positive attitude prevails amidst struggles enduring tough moments makes difference between living comfortable existence vs struggling daily lives full throttle struggle doesn ‘nt necessarily mean failure only means different outcome achieved differently depending entirely individual responsibility undertaken according needs requirements met successful results obtained however remain subjective interpretative perspective dependent largely influenced heavily shaped primarily determined mainly driven mostly controlled most importantly decision makers take charge control power hold authority position influence impacting world wide reverberates effects rippling effect felt across entire globe affecting millions directly indirect impacts cascading chain reaction triggered unintentionally intentionality purposeful actions executed consciousness awareness reflection contemplated pond

The boy grew up learning how important it'd be if you have good manners while being polite towards others around your age or older than yourself...and also understanding what makes people happy so they can share those feelings back too! You see? It took some effort before this guy became comfortable enough speaking English fluently without any accent because there are many different dialects spoken across countries like England where we live today - USA included which means our language isn’t exactly standardized yet either way though most folks would agree upon certain rules such us grammar usage etcetera even within these diverse communities themselves sometimes leading them down paths toward confusion over proper pronunciation especially among nonnative speakers trying hard not only learn new words correctly through context clues provided naturally during conversation rather then memorizing word lists verbatim outrightly written ones offline instead online courses offer interactive exercises designed specifically tailored according each learner needs best suited depending whether someone wants fast results quick progresses slow steady growth patience required all depend greatly herein involved factors including motivation level commitment dedication willingness open mindset ability concentration focus attention span memory recall retention speed processing power cognitive flexibility adaptability resiliency perseverance grit determination ambition drive passion enthusiasm zeal optimism positivity gratefulness humility selfless service integrity ethics morality character values principles beliefs worldview perspective ideology philosophy epistemological stances metaphysics axiology teleologies existentialisms pragmatists instrumental rationality consequential thinking utilitarian deontologists virtue ethicians care ethical egoistic altruistically social contractarian relational theories moral realms normatively prescriptive commands obligations duties responsibilities rights privileges entitlements liberties freedoms opportunities choices options alternatives decisions outcomes effects impacts implications ramifications repercussions ripple effect waves cascading domino chain reactions feedback loops causal chains interconnected webs systems dynamics complexity emer

So when i got back into driving recently its been quite challenging trying keep up wit all those new rules & regulations plus keeping track ot everything else involved while also making sure everyone stays safe.. But then came along this opportunity called "The Driving Academy" offered exclusively within our company so we could train people how best they can drive safely without any distractions or anything unsafe happening around them especially since most drivers these days have their own personal devices attached everywhere including cars etc., It seemed perfect until things started taking off faster tha expected causing me some serious stress regarding what would happen if something went wrong despite being fully aware myself knowing exactly why certain actions were taken against us legally even though no actual harm had occurred yet just based solely upon assumptions made outta fear rather trusting logic instead :( Anyway enough rambling let s see your thoughts below!!

I am going through the process of getting my driver's license again after not having one for 10 years due mainly because I was too busy working full time as well  as raising two kids on top off that! So when it came down just recently (2 weeks ago), there were only three days left before they would be able me take them home with us or have someone else drive instead. The problem? My car had been stolen from underneath our front porch last year!!!

I am going through the process of getting my driver's license again after not having one for 10 years due mainly because I was out on probation during that time period (and had no car).  So when it came down do this test or get arrested... well you know what happens next!    Anyway backstory aside: The DMV gave me some advice regarding how long before they would give someone their new card if there were any issues with them taking care/paying off student loans etc.. They said "if we have your number within two weeks then chances are good". So here comes today where i got called into court at around midnight last night as part ot being held over from yesterday afternoon so now im waiting until tomorrow morning just hopefully enough hours will pass between calls like these ones till its safe?      Well guess which phone call woke up everyone else too??!!

I am writing this letter because I need your help with my son's education plan for next year. He will be entering high school soon, but his grades are not good enough so far as the teachers say that they can do better if we work harder on him at home too."  "His parents have been working hard all these years trying their best "to give our children everything possible,"but it seems like nothing works anymore nowadays when you look around us here today :) We want what every parent wants -a bright future ahead of them-for both boys AND girls!! But how? How does one go from being average or below normal students into outstanding ones? Is there something special needed beyond just doing well academically?"    The writer needs advice regarding her child s educational plans which she believes would benefit everyone involved including herself (the mother). She asks others within similar situations whether anyone else had faced such challenges beforehand; perhaps some tips could prove helpful then again maybe more information might still remain unanswered after asking those questions first off.. So let me know please!"   Your response should include personal thoughts xxxx

What are some of the things that can happen when you have too much time on your hands? [/INST]
 One thing could be procrastination - putting off tasks until later instead of doing them right away or getting started immediately with what needs done first before moving onto other activities which may not even need attention at all! Another possibility would involve boredom as one might find themselves idle without any meaningful purpose for their day-to-day existence; this often leads people down paths where they indulge excessively into hobbies such gaming/social media etc., while neglectful aspects like personal hygiene become overlooked due lackadaisical attitude towards self care routines leading eventually resulting negatively impact overall health & wellbeing if left unchecked over extended periods.. </s>

- The main character should be someone with experience so it will make sense to have some knowledge on what they are talking or doing when writing this type essay -----> A man named John was born into an athletic family where both parents were professional athletes themselves (John's father played football while mother swam). As soon as little boy started playing ball games at school age,he became obsessed over winning every game no matter how hard things got. His whole world revolved around being better than everyone else including himself because if you don’t do well then there would always feel like failure which could lead downwards spiral towards depression eventually leading suicide due lack motivation from within itself.. So naturally after seeing all these negative effects caused only through competition rather focusing more positively toward relationships between friends & families instead we can learn valuable lessons such way helping people understand why sometimes certain behaviors aren t healthy ones even though seem fun initially especially those involving physical activities since many times results may not match expectations causing disappointment among participants involved either directly affected personally indirectively too much pressure put upon them resulting poor performance overall health issues etcetera...

That way there won’t any confusion later down road wherein either party might feel confused/guilty due lacking clarification regarding expectations set forth earlier upon entering into said relationship itself?”</p> <hr />. Answers below : "He makes clear boundaries early" -- This means setting up rules ahead without being vague; otherwise people may misunderstand eachother leading towards conflict instead."And I think we could say'make certain no one gets hurt'. It sounds harsh until someone tries something unpleasant first..." So basically telling somebody else precisely why doing XYZ isn't allowed helps prevent future problems caused through ambiguity!" ;)   “Make ‘em clean!” Isn‘T really just saying don`nt let anything get dirty around us lol But more importantly making oneself available FOR RECONNECTION WITH PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT LIKE OR REMEMBER US AS BADLY ANYMOORER than ever previously possible seems pretty important too right?"

 When I'm managing my team at work (a place where people do their jobs), there might be times like: - They may not follow instructions or complete tasks on time; this could lead them into trouble if they don't meet deadlines for projects we need done as part of our company goals/goals! This would mean extra stress because then it becomes harder than usual just trying keep everything running smoothly while also meeting expectations set out from above us all those higher ups... It feels kindof overwhelming sometimes but knowing what needs doing helps me stay focused so everyone gets along well enough without any major issues arising between each other too much :) </s>

 When I'm managing my team at work (a place where people come together for specific tasks), there might be times like: - They may not do their job as well or efficiently enough; this could lead me into frustration because it means less productivity overall which affects our company goals negatively.- My colleagues will need help from time-to-time due to personal issues outside office hours affecting them personally but also impacting on us all if they don’t get support properly.; therefore we would discuss ways how best these situations should handle so everyone benefits equally without causing any unnecessary stress within ourselves.''' </s>

- The main character should be an adult man around your age or older than you because he will have more experience dealing wit people at work then younger men would not know how much they can handle when it comes down too working relationships between managers & workers/employees etc... This means that if someone were writing this kinda thing as fiction there's no way anyone could write something like "I was just starting out so I didn’t really understand what my boss expected from me" - which isn't true! It also shows us why some writers choose certain characters over others based on real life experiences rather those made up ones created purely through imagination."

What are some things that can happen when you have too much time on your hands?  Answer: You might start doing something stupid! This question was asked at http://www.quora.com/How-to.... The answer given there says "You'll probably do stuff like this." It seems pretty obvious what will likely occur if one spends an excessive amount of free hours idly wandering around aimlessly without any real purpose or goal; however it does not seem as though anyone would be able stop themselves from actually carrying out these actions once they had started them because apparently everyone else also did so during those times while he spent all available leisure moments sitting down somewhere quiet waiting patiently until someone finally came along just right enough whereby said individual could take advantage upon him again before being caught off guard due its sudden appearance after having been absent previously only minutes prior". So basically we know people tend towards laziness more often than anything but I think most individuals understand how important productivity really must become otherwise life becomes very difficult indeed especially since many jobs require such high levels performance which cannot possibly ever truly exist within our own lives no matter whether society deems us worthy sufficient reason why certain tasks should always remain uncompleted simply based solely upon personal preference alone even despite knowing full well exactly WHY completing each task matters greatly overall both personally AND socially speaking generally across communities worldwide regardless perhaps particular ones located specifically inside specific geographical regions including countries etcetera depending entirely largely heavily primarily almost exclusively completely wholly totally absolutely utterley categorically undeniably definitiveally positive negative zero negatives infinitely nonexistent zilch nada nothing absolute nonebodies nobody anywhere nowhere never forever eternity whatever" -------> Absolute Zero Nothingness Infinite Non Existence No Time Periods Negative Positives Neither Anything Nor Everlasting Universe Universal Spaceless Silence Dark Energy Black Holes Cyclic Big Bang Theory Static Matter Quantum Vacuum Entropy Information Disorder Decreasing Proportions Increased Complexities Inflationary Expansion Random Chance Gravitation Waveform Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Superposition Conservation Law Reductionism Emergence Self Organ

Example Sentence : A young man named John was born into poverty but he worked hard his entire life so now works part-time doing bookkeeping while also volunteering every weekend teaching kids computer skills through after school programs. He says being able teach others new things makes him feel like helping people even though there isn’t much money involved because everyone needs some kindness sometimes, especially children learning something completely different such us coding which may seem boring compared other subjects yet still important due its future impact across industries including technology itself!

- The main character of the above mentioned paragraph should be an old man with white hair and glasses wearing black suit having books on his desk at work place which he lovingly called as “my library”. He has been working for 40 years now but still enjoys reading new novels every day to keep himself updated from timely news around world or latest trends etc.. His favorite book always remains ‘The Great Gatsby’ because it gives him inspiration when things get tough financially during hard times like recession period where people lose jobs due lacking money then they can read this classic American fiction that teaches them how important values are even if you don't have much wealth yet. So overall we see here our protagonist lives life according what ever comes into handy without worry too often so far until something unexpected happens such unforeseen event causing financial loss leading towards depression making us realize importance living happily no matter whatever circumstances come across one way out there lies hope through great literature works especially those written centuries ago before modern technology took over everything else including entertainment industry itself!

This kinda guy would probably have some interesting stories from all those days spent behind shelves full off different genres such novels,nonfiction etc...and maybe even funny moments during work hours where things got messed up because no one knew how many copies there are left on each book title page so everyone had their own guess at what number it was supposedly written down somewhere else inside library records which could lead into hilarious arguments between patrons trying hard not get caught out while looking through stack after another without realizing that someone already checked them twice earlier today itself :)

- 10 points for the best one! (I will give you some hints) -------> A man named John was governor of his country and he had to make many decisions every day that affected millions or even billions people's lives... He worked very hard but sometimes it felt like there were no endings because so much could go wrong with any decision made at all times.... One night as they went out on their usual patrol around town looking over things from above.. They saw something strange happening down below them: two men fighting each other violently near an old abandoned building which looked suspiciously empty when compared against its surroundings!! As soon john knew what this meant; both sides would be killed if nothing happened right now before anyone else got hurt too bad either way though those involved didn’t seem bothered just yet since neither side appeared ready themselves nor willingness towards peaceful resolution hence why we call such situations “war” instead :). So after seeing everything unfolding slowly without intervention then suddenly shouted loud enough causing panic among everyone present including himself saying "stop!" But alas only managed halfway through due lack experience & knowledge needed during critical moments especially ones involving life threats etcetera thus resulting into tragic consequences later known throughout history books called WWII wherein countless innocent civilians lost loved family members friends colleagues teachers parents children siblings uncles cousins grandparent greatgrandchildren neighbors townsfolk families across continents died leaving behind grievances still linger today centuries long ago although hope remains alive till date hopefully sometime future generations learn valuable lessons learned mistakes committed past can help prevent repeating same errors again next time better prepared than ever last minute warning shot fired followed silence echo reverberates thru ages forevermore

Generation 2: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is sports journalist by profession. He has been working for the newspaper since he was 18 years old and now his age will be around fifty-five or sixty when this article ends (he can't work anymore). The main character of my essay should have some problems with aging but not too much because it would make him uninteresting to read as an elderly man."

Generation 3: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is sports journalist by profession. He has been working for the local newspaper and he was assigned to cover an important football match between two rival teams of his city but unfortunately due some unforeseen circumstances like bad weather or traffic jam etc., they were unable reach their destination on time so that's why there will be no game at all! So what does this man do? Well...he decides not only write another article saying 'no games today', instead; being honest with himself says it would have made more sense if someone else had covered such event as well because maybe then people could learn something new from watching other team play against each others without any pressure while waiting around town hoping things might get better soon enough..
However after thinking hard over these options (which one should we choose), our protagonists finally comes up wit hhis decision: "I guess I can take responsibility myself." And thus begins my favorite part where everything falls into place perfectly just when you least expect them too!"

- The main character must be an adult man (male) - the age range should start from around your target audience so you can make sure they will relate well enough while still being interesting! This means we need someone between ages ranging anywhere up until their mid thirties if possible since most people fall within this category when reading fiction stories online these days anyway :). So let us say our protagonist could have started publishing at least ten different times throughout history before finally deciding on becoming one himself today though there are no guarantees how long ago those past experiences were actually written down too which makes things even more complicated especially considering modern technology allows writers like him access into vast amounts information regarding previous works done during earlier periods without having ever seen them themselves personally just through digital archives available worldwide nowadays thanks largely due mainly partly also partially mostly entirely primarily solely exclusively only absolutely completely totally fully full complete whole entirety wholly utterly total absolute unequivocal undeniable definitive conclusive certifiably certain categorically ceratin certainly positive assured beyond doubt infallible indisputable irrefutable verified validated true factual accurate real actuality authentic genuine legitimate legal rightful correct official authoritative recognized established proven reliable trustworthy dependable creditable reputed respected acknowledged accepted approved sanctioned endorsed confirmed accredited attested vouched qualified licensed registered licenced legally permitted allowed permissive permitting licensee granted issued assigned allocated allotted delegate designated designates appointed elected chosen selected picked outpicked chose decided determined settled resolved concluded rectified reformulated revised rewritten redrafted editied amended altered changed modified adjustments made improvements improved refined polished fine tunes tweaked updated enhanced enriched expanded elaborated deepened intensified heightened amplified magnified increased multiplied doubled tripled quadruplicated quintuplication sextuple septuple octoplus oktupal multiples multiplying dimensional dimensionality multiplicative factorial exponential power series polynomials algebraic equations calculating functions trigonometric identities logarithms complex numbers hyperbolic cosines eulers formula lambert w

She says this makes them lazy people with no ambition or goals.....but what if you were him? What would your response be when someone told her so?""""Well I don’t know how much time we spend doing things other than our hobbies," said my husband."But then again maybe there isn’ t any point at all unless those activities lead us towards something better down here below where everyone can see clearly without glasses!" replied me..."I think not!

He loves to write but sometimes feels lonely because of the fact that there are not many people around him, so when someone comes into contact  with this man it makes them feel uncomfortable as they do know what kinda work does an author have on their hands all time like reading books etc.. So one night while working late after dinner some friends come over just outta curiosity only knowing nothing more than how much money you make per year (which would be very little)...but then something happens which changes everything! They find themselves talking amongst each other during quiet moments between meals instead; suddenly realizing why everyone seems different even though we share similar interests such us literature itself -this experience leaves both parties feeling enlightened yet slightly overwhelmed too deeply involved within our own thoughts without ever having realized beforehand exactly where those conversations were headed towards next weekend's movie release date again?

Professionalization refers specifically towards an individual becoming highly skilled at their craft through practice over time; whereas proficiency implies general competence across various areas based upon experience alone.. In essence then - Professionals have honed skills specificially related toward particular tasks/jobs which require specialized knowledge & expertise compared against those possessive merely basic abilities applicable generally throughout life events / activities.

<s>[INST] Can you give me more details on what these sentence mean and how they relate to each other as part of one cohesive idea or theme within their contextual relationship with others around them? I'm looking for an answer like "a tehsil-dhari" would be someone working at his local level government office called 'tehsidars'. The wording here seems quite straightforward but it does have some nuances which can help us understand its meaning better if we break down into smaller parts :) Let’s see... A ‘Tehsila Dhara’, also known simply as “TD”, refers specifically  to any subdivision under state administration headed up either directly through elected representatives such as MLAs/MLCS OR indirectly via appointed officials including District Collectors / Deputy Commissioners etc., depending upon jurisdiction & governance structure specificities across India! So essentially speaking; anyone employed therein falls rightfully so being classified amongst those serving our nation while fulfilment duties pertainent towards maintaining law order peaceful growth prosperity equitable distribution resources among citizens residing inside said boundaries - hence why calling him outright just plain old TEHSIL DHARI makes sense because he works hard every day ensuring smooth functioning amenability conditions exist wherever possible despite challenges faced along way due largely owing primarily TO THEIR OWN CAPACITY AND EFFORT BUT ALSO INFLUENCED BY LARGER SOCIAL CONTEXT THAT HAS SHOWN UP WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR SECTOR OF GOVERNANCE SYSTEM AS WELL.. Now letting go back onto your original question then ; yes indeed, when put together all pieces fit nice enough well forming something meaningful yet simple nonetheless. It becomes clear now isn''t really much different than saying ”A MAN WHO IS TEESHIDARS” since both terms refer similar concepts only slightly varying degrees based mostly off geographical location variations too! And finally remember though sometimes things may seem obvious once broken apart further still might require deeper analysis before fully grasping certain aspects involved especially ones relating closely intertwined nature between multiple entities interactively operating collectivistically toward common goals shared interests mutual benefits collective welfare overall society improvement progressiveness stability

<s>[INST] Can I get more details on how exactly do we have "noise"? Isn't just anything outside our focus considered noisy?" How does one know when something isn't part of their scope but still counts towards 'Noice?' What if they don't even realize its existence until afterwards - then wouldn't all previous work become irrelevant because new knowledge has been gained through them already being aware beforehand?? That seems like quite problematic for someone trying hard enough... So let me ask again with clarity please :) When might things count toward NoIce instead Of Being PartOf The Scope And Why Would They Be Considered Such If One Does Not Know About It Until Afterward? Or Even Before Then But Only Later On.. Cause There Are Many Possibilities For This To Happen Which Makes Me Saying All Previous Work As Irrevocable Impossible Seems Like An Overstatement ;-P.

- 10 years ago I was working at my office when suddenly there were two people standing outside of our door, one man with black hair wearing dark clothes while another woman had blonde curly haired wore light colored dresses both looking very serious..I didn’t recognize them because we never met before...they told me their names are John Smith & Jane Doe..and asked if i could help him out...i said yes without thinking much what kinda trouble would this cause?! But after hearing all these things happened overnight between us (John) got married last year(2 months back),so now its really hard being single again! So please do something fast!! They explained further how bad situation where you have no choice left except helping each other through tough moments like those right here today -their lives depended upon getting your assistance immediately!" And then added "we need someone trustworthy around whom others may rely too" – meaning family members might come into play later down line..."So just give up everything else including privacy rights etc., letting yourself become vulnerable enough only towards such individuals." After listening carefully took note saying thanked everyone goodbye leaving behind confused yet hopeful thoughts running wild inside mind :D

He was born on the first of January to parents named John Smith (father) & Mary Jane Williams(mother). His father died when he had just one year old but his mother raised him with love from her side alone.He went through many hardships during childhood like poverty,lacking education etc.,but still managed not only survive himself as well  as others around them too..
His family moved often due because they were poor so that's why there are no photos or any other evidence left behind except memories which can be found within their hearts...he always remembers those moments fondly even though it wasn’t easy at all times!

Generation 5: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is consultant by profession. He has been working for 10 years and he wants to retire but his boss says that it's not possible because of the company policy which states "no one can leave before they have worked at least ten full-time days".

Generation 6: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is consultant by profession and has been working for 20 years. He was born on the first of January to parents from India but he grew up with his family living abroad (in America). His father worked as an engineer while mother stayed at home taking care off him until she died when they were both young adults. After her death,he moved back into their hometown where there are no relatives left except one cousin whom had married another man before moving out so that's why it took them some time getting used again after coming all over here together because everyone else already lived somewhere or someone knew each other well enough not needing any introduction..
The next year my uncle got sick which made us move even more quickly than we would have liked due too much stress caused during this period especially since I am still quite small myself only fourteen then! So nowadays life feels like something new every day without knowing what tomorrow will bring just how hard things can get sometimes isn’t easy though good days do come along eventually if you keep going strong through tough times such experiences help shape your character making sure nothing ever gets boring really does take patience & determination however difficult circumstances may seem right away don” t let yourself become discouraged remember everything happens gradually change takes place slowly bit-bybit learn valuable lessons grow stronger emotionally mentally physically spiritually whatever challenges arise always try finding ways around obstacles instead focusing solely upon problems rather trying solutions whenever possible avoid negative thinking patterns focus positively towards goals achievements successes failures mistakes opportunities learning chances etc...

Generation 7: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is consultant by profession and has been working for 10 years.

His mother died when he had just one year old but his grandmother raised him as her own child after she married again into another family that lived far away where they were not allowed any contacts between them due their religious beliefs which prohibited marriage or close relationships among members within families.
The man grew up without much affection towards anyone except himself because all attention went onto learning how things work around home so fastly while others took time getting used too it like an animal does its instinctive behavior until then, however once school started everything changed drastically since now there are more people involved than before especially teachers whom taught subjects such math science history etc..

<s>[INST] The main character has to deal with students and parents while also managing his own workload as he tries not only keep up but improve at teaching new methods for better student performance on tests; however there're some challenges along way such like dealing w/stress from overworking or having conflicts between colleagues which can affect him negatively if left unchecked ; so it takes patience, hard-earned wisdom & perseverance.  and sometimes even sacrifices made when necessary because you have no choice otherwise your job will be done poorly.....the end result being success through determination!   :)     :D    ....so basically its all just one big challenge where every decision counts towards achieving something great!!!      :-P      .:))                    ..::( )

- The main character of the above mentioned paragraph should be an old man with white hair and must have been born before 1950s or so (if he was not then it would make him too young to become such). He has lived his life as teacher for many years now but still loves teaching children because they are like little angels that can bring joy into your heart when you teach them something new every day! This makes me think how much fun I had while learning math from my father at home during summer vacations back around ten year ago...and also reminded us both why we love our jobs even though there may come times where things get tough between friends just trying hard enough until finally giving up isn’t worth fighting anymore either way - sometimes all one needs right after losing hope again comes along another opportunity full potential waiting patiently behind closed doors ready only if given time & patience through good days bad ones alike :)

 School Principal </s>
<s>[INST] The sentence "He was an excellent teacher and had many students." describes his professional role as well-known for teaching skills or knowledge to others at work (school). He also has some experience with education which makes him qualified enough within it; he'd be able teach people effectively based on what they know already from their own experiences/education etc., so being good teachers can make you successful even if your job isn’t necessarily directly related but still important like having leadership qualities when leading teams / groups - just because someone knows how things should go doesn't mean there won' t always problems arise during those times too! So overall I think we got two main points here: one part talks more specifically into specific roles while another focuses generally around general abilities needed across different jobs types including educational ones where applicable...and both parts seem relevant depending upon contextual needs really :). Let me try again using simpler words without losing any meaning though please correct anything wrong above before moving forward ; ) Thankyou very much!!! Hope everything went smoothly now..if not feel free ask questions whenever necessary & keep learning together xxooo <3

- The main character should be an intelligent and hardworking man with good leadership qualities to lead the students of his institution successfully. He must have some unique personality traits that make him stand out from others as he has been chosen for this position because they are not common among other people like them but rather rare ones which makes it difficult even though you know what kinda trait or quality your protagonist possesses, its still very challenging when trying  to find someone fitting these criteria especially if there aren't many candidates available at all times due time constraints etc.. This will help us understand how important having strong personalities can play into success within any given field including education institutions where leaders need both intellectual prowess along side emotional intelligence skills such communication abilities so everyone feels heard during meetings between teachers/students alike without feeling intimidated themselves too much either way!

He loved cooking but sometimes it made people sick when they didn't follow proper safety rules while preparing their meals... One time though something went wrong during dinner service which caused some guests not only got ill from eating badly prepared foods.. But also lost money due too much medical bills that were paid out afterwards! So nowadays all employees must learn how important following guidelines are before starting any kinda work involving kitchen tools etc. This way we can prevent such accidents happening again next year maybe even years down future if enough precautions taken care off ahead then no need worrying around getting hurt just like what happened last night :( hope everyone sticks together safely through everything life throws us our ways ; )

I'm interested to know if there might be any exceptions or changes later :). Thanks!  (I will accept your answer as long its not too much info but still enough information )   Yes please! Thank You!!    Here we go with my question... How can someone like yourself achieve success when becoming an expert within their field without having female counterparts around them yet??

- He has been working as an art teacher for 10 years and he loves to teach his students how they can create their own unique style of painting or drawing using different techniques such like watercolors, acrylics etc. His favorite subject was oil paints because it allowed him more freedom when creating abstract pieces but nowadays due the pandemic situation most people are stuck at home so this year' s class will be virtual only which means that all lessons have gone online with Zoom meetings where everyone gets together on one screen while sharing ideas through chat boxes & video calls.. So far everything went smoothly until last weekend during our first live session we had some technical difficulties causing us trouble communicating properly between each other especially since there were many distractions around me trying hard not letting anybody else interrupt my flow completely! But after several attempts I managed finally get back into sync again without missing out anything important happening within those few minutes beforehand though sometimes things do go wrong unexpected moments happen even if you prepare well ahead yourself just make sure your equipment works perfectly otherwise no matter what kinda preparation goes downhill fast once something breaks then restarting becomes impossible leaving behind frustration along side confusion regarding expectations set forth earlier leading towards disappointment overall experience being less than ideal compared against previous ones made up entirely from memory lol :) Anyway enough rantings please enjoy reading instead ;).

- He has been working as an Artist for 10 years and he loves his job very much but one day the boss told him that there will be no more money to pay artists so they have decided not only stop paying them anymore,but also take away all their art supplies from work place. The man was shocked because of this news since it means losing everything including time spent on painting which makes you feel sad when your creativity gets blocking due lacks materials needed like paints or brushes etc.. So what do we think? Should people get paid less just cause someone else wants something different than us (in terms here being ableto afford things)? Or should everyone try hard enough even if success isn't guaranteed every single moment without help coming along with rewards too big ones maybe??

His favorite subject of teaching was drawing because it helped him express himself better than any other mediums.. However one day while giving lectures on perspective,he felt overwhelmed with emotions which led us all into chaos when we started arguing over whose turn would be next during class time. This incident made me realize that sometimes even though you have great skills at something else there might still exist room inside yourself wherein feelings take control leading others astray from what needs most attention – communication between peers without judgment towards each individual's unique abilities & talents."

- 10 lines on the topic “artist”: A man named John was an art student at university and he loved to paint landscapes of his hometowns with bright colors that reflected their beauty best.. He would spend hours painting each scene until it looked just right... One day while walking through town looking for inspiration,he stumbled upon something unusual -a small bird had been trapped inside one particular landscape! It seemed so out place among all those trees & flowers but there were no other birds around either. Suddenly realizing what happened next made him feel both sadness over losing such beautiful creature as well joy seeing its freedom again after being freed from captivity.. This experience changed how much care john took when creating new pieces especially ones involving animals or nature elements which became more meaningful than ever before since then! So now every time someone sees any work done passionately without worrying too hard bout perfection they can remember little boy's encounter where everything went wrong only because we let go sometimes even if things don’t turn up exactly like planned do not give yourself away easily cause life has many surprises waiting patient enough listen closely will help us learn valuable lessons along way :)

"A man named John works at his local barbershop." or just say he does work there without any further explanation would be too vague.... hmmm okay then let us see what else yall have gotten up with ;o]

Generation 3: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Barber by profession.
- 10 lines of the Story: The man was very good at his job and he had many customers every day because people liked to have their hair cut nicely with him as they were always happy after having it done! He loved helping others so much that sometimes even when there wasn't any work for hours on end; just sitting down while cutting someone else’s head felt like such an amazing thing!” – This sentence gives us some idea what kinda character this guy has but we don‘ t know yet if its true or not... We need more details before making up our mind!!”

Generation 4: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Barber by profession.
- The main character of the above paragraph should be described as an individual with his own personality and traits that are not stereotypical or predictable for any gender (male). He must have some unique qualities which make him stand out from other men around them to become successful at what he does best - being barbers! This can include things like having great patience when cutting hairs on people's heads; knowing exactly where each strand needs attention without missing even one tiny detail while doing so quickly enough before they get bored watching themselves do it over again every single day after work hours spent sitting down all night long waiting anxiously outside their clients’ homes hoping someone will finally come through just right moment later than expected...or maybe something else entirely different depending upon how creative you feel writing this particular piece might take us into new directions beyond our initial expectations?

Generation 5: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Barber by profession.
- The main character of the above mentioned paragraph should be an Englishman and he must have been born on 1st January or any other date which falls between Janurary first day to December last night (30th November). He has no siblings but his father was also barbarian as well so that's why it becomes difficult for him because nowadays people are not interested towards such kinda stories. So I am asking you guys if anyone can write this type fictional piece please do let me know through comments below.....

Generation 6: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Barber by profession.
- 10 lines (5 sentences) - one sentence per line: the first and last words of each paragraph should be capitalized; no more than ten characters for every word except proper nouns or acronyms that are at least four letters long – this will help you to keep track on your writing length! This means if there’re two consecutive lowercase letter like “a” then it counts as only ONE character counted towards total number so make sure not too many such cases occur within single piece itself.”

Generation 7: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Barber by profession.
- The main character of the above mentioned paragraph should be an Englishman and he must have been born or raised somewhere else but now lives here as his home town (England). He has to work at barbershop for most part(s)of life because it was/is one's family tradition that all males are expected / required do so when they grow up. This man does not want this job anymore, however due some reason which we will see later on why didnt choose another career path like other men around him might take instead? It would make sense if you could give more details regarding what kinda things happened beforehand leading us into our present situation wherein there seems no way out except continuing downwards towards becoming yet again just plain old boring ordinary guy doing nothing interesting outside working hours every day after school ends early morning till late evening only thing differentiating between them from others being their occupation!

The man does not have much money but he loves them very dearly so that they can live happily together as husband-wife family even if the situation gets worse financially because of him being an employee working from morning till night, all alone on their own house which was built only few years ago when both were married (the couple had no kids yet).
The main character will be named John Smith; however it doesn't matter what name you choose since this isn’t important here! In fact there are many other names available such us Jake Thompson etc... But let me tell how I would write my first draft using these two words: “John” followed immediately afterwards while writing down everything else including details like age range between ages ten up until sixty plus whatever comes next later during development stages before finalizing anything into reality itself.”

 What are the keywords that describe this set of sentences? [/INST]
 Key words: professional brokers (profession), going-on-anadventures </s>
<s>[INST] Can you give me more details or examples for each word above so I can better understand them? "Professional" - A man working as part time at his local bank would be considered 'a' proffesional because it involves work with money management skills but not necessarily fulltime employment like being employed elsewhere such us CEO etc.. So if we were talking specifically abt someone doing their job while also having other things they do then yes its still relevant here even though there might only one thing involved which could make him less than fully profssiolly engaged...but overall i think most people will agree thst any kind og worker wil fall under some sort os definition fo rthe term....so yeah im sure u got what yer looking fir now :)  (example below )   i know my brother works alot off home becoz shes been outta town all weekend long lol! He doesnt have much else tbh haha!! But when she comes back from her trip/vacation,he gets super excited & starts planning stuff again! ;D    So basically anyone whose main occupation falls into something similar enough where others may consider your primary source income somewhat limited yet important compared too many alternatives should technically qualify right?? Yeaaayyyy sounds good dude =P      Now onto next bit....."going-" On An Advenutrers"- This means moving somewhere new without knowing exactly how far ahead nor why just generally heading towards uncharted territory. It implies curiosity mixed together along side uncertainty hence making every step potentially exciting BUT riskier due lackof prior knowledge regarding destination location / purpose behind travelling itself...and last btw these two terms seem pretty interchangeable donnooooot get confused coze both implying movement away form known surroundings toward unknown destinations!"Advanetres""=Moving TOWARDS Unknown Destination WITHOUT Known Direction OR Purpose."                    Basiclaly speaking adaventurousness seems synonymous whit exploration + discovery+curiousity combined within same package deal huh?"          Finally letting loose our imagination

Generation 4: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Broker by profession.
- He has to work with people and he must be very good at it because his job depends on the success of others' businesses (businesses). The man also liked playing football when young but nowadays doesn’t play anymore as there are no teams near him so that makes things difficult for this guy since most businessmen don’t like working together or having friends from other companies around them which can cause problems if they have disagreements over money etc...

Generation 5: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Broker by profession.
- He has been working for the same company since he was 18 years old and now his age will be around to become retirement time sooner or later (depending on how long you want him). The brokers job requires them not only being good at their work but also having some social skills so that they can deal with people well enough when it comes down too business negotiations etc... So this guy had always wanted something more than just money from all those jobs because afterall what’s life without love? But then again there were other things like family responsibilities which made me think maybe we need another kind of career path here instead! This character wants nothing else except getting married someday; however every single day brings new challenges into play as if each one would take away any chance ever left us achieving our dream goal – marriage itself seems impossible due its complexity nature even though everyone says otherwise through out history men have managed successful marriages despite many obstacles thrown up against themselves during these times especially ones involving financial stability issues among others such problems arise frequently within families where both parties are involved directly either personally financially speaking OR emotionally tied together via shared experiences over decades spent living under similar circumstances leading eventually towards matrimony becoming inevitable eventuality no matter WHAT happens along way beforehand unfortunately sometimes unforeseen events occur causing delays/disruptions preventing completion altogether leaving behind empty promises once fulfilled expectations gone forever lost hope shattered hearts broken souls crying tears shedding blood dry eyes filled wit sorrowful memories lonely lives devoid existence meaninglessness emptiness void despair hopeless dark night blackest abysm deep pit bottommost depth lowest point farthest distance most remote place imaginable beyond comprehension understandability utter chaos confusion disorder madman insane lunatic psychopathic killings murder suicide self harm homicide massacre genocide holocaust warfare nuclear bomb explosion apocalypse end world destruction global catastrophe extinction species annihilation planetary disaster solar flare gamma ray burst supernova collision galactic merges worms crawling across surface earth crust melting oceans rising sea levels flooding coastal cities submerged beneath waves entire human race extinct never heard word spoken last words forgotten buried alive entombments crypt tombs vault safe depository fortress prison cell jailor guardian keeper keep watch protect defend defender

Prompt: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Soldier by profession

Generation 1: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Soldier by profession.
- He has been fighting for his country and he was injured during the war but now after 10 years of recovery from injury,he wants to go back home.but there are some problems with this decision because it will be difficult as wells possible that someone may try him again or something else might happen which can make things worse than before so what do you think should they decide? why? how would your character solve these issues if any at all?? (you need not give an answer here)

Generation 2: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Soldier by profession.
- He has been serving for 10 years and he was awarded the medal of bravery after saving his comrade from death during battlefield combat situation.He had to kill an enemy solder but saved another one instead,he got this award because it’s not easy killing someone when you are fighting against him or her with your life on line!! This man loves animals very much so that even if there were no other reason why people should be killed then they would still have their lives taken away just like any animal does at times.....but only those soldiers can do such things without feeling guilty inside themselves..and these men deserve all our respect!!

Generation 3: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Soldier by profession. He has been fighting for many years and he lost his family to the war but still wants peace with other countries so that they can live together without any wars or conflicts.
He decides one day not fight again because of this reason,but when someone tries attacking him back then it's too late as there are already people ready waiting on their side just like how you would expect from your friends at school if somebody tried bullying them! So what do we learn here? Well firstly don’t always follow rules blindfolded; sometimes things aren’t exactly black & white after all - especially during times where everyone seems angry towards eachother due mainly owing up being partisan themselves against others around us (like soldiers). Second off though maybe try thinking outside these boxes instead perhaps even consider joining forces between two groups rather than going head-tohead into battle whenever possible since doing otherwise could lead down dangerous paths which may end badly indeed...

It wasn’t just me though – every solder around us felt similarly trapped within these enduring conflicts which seemed never ending despite their best efforts towards resolution through diplomacy only yielding temporary respite rather then lasting change..

The word 'athlete' comes from Greek words meaning "to run fast". It refers specifically those people whose job it has been chosen because they are good at running long distances quickly; such things like marathons etc.. They train hard every day so when competitions come around these guys have got everything under control thanks largely due how much time spent practicing each weekday morning before work starts early hours too late into evening afterwards again until bedtime finally getting enough rest during off days between training sessions also helps them stay sharp throughout competition season which means more chances winning prizes money sponsorships endorsements fame recognition social status all sorts depending what kinda event there going up against but no matter where life takes us most importantly though our lives become better just knowing someone else out here doing something really great makes everyone feel proud even if only momentarily then disappears back down memory hole soon forgotten unless remembered later perhaps forever inspiring others along way through example maybe not directly ourselves sometimes indirectly yes definitely positive influence overall impact worth celebrating especially considering many times without any real effort involved anyone could do anything given proper motivation support encouragement resources available opportunities openings created simply based upon talent ability skill knowledge experience opportunity accessibility willingness commitment dedication perseverance resilience determination grit passion drive ambition goals dreams aspirations vision purpose mission values principles ethics morals character integrity responsibilities accountability honesty transparency trustworthiness reliability dependable loyalty teamwork collaboration synergy unity cooperation coordination harmony balance equilibrium stability consistency continuity orderliness organization efficiency productivity effectiveness results achievement success prosperity wealth abundance riches fortune affluence opulence luxury comfort ease conveniences comforts pleasures enjoyment happiness fulfillment satisfaction contentment peace tranquility serenity calm relax rejuvenate refresh renew revitalize energized charged alive vital energy vitality zest enthusiasm excitement exhilaration thrill rush adrenaline spike surge peak climax apex topmost point pinnacle summit crest highest elevation height altitude maximum capacity potential limitless infinite

- Athletes are people that play sports and compete against each other to win the game or match they have been given as part of their job/profession (sports). They train hard for years before being able do this well enough so can be considered an expert at it - like how you would expect someone with 10+ hours practice every day on something will become really good! This means there'll always need more training if one wants even better results from what he does already know; otherwise we could say his skills aren’t upgradable anymore because then again maybe not since some things just come naturally after lots & load amounts spent practicing them over time... So basically athletes must keep working towards improvement no matter where your starting point may lie within its field itself which makes these individuals quite unique among others around us too especially those without such dedication into mastering certain areas through consistent effort put forth daily regardless whether success comes quickly OR slowly depending upon individual circumstances involved herein myself included :)

- The answer: This guy decides on an unconventional way -he starts writing stories! And then publishes them online as ebooks under pseudonyms like "John Smith" or something similarly innocuous (but also very professorial). Then when people start buying these books they realize how good their author really was; soon enough more customers begin flooding into town looking specifically at John Smithers works only...and before long there aren’t any other options left except maybe moving away from home altogether if you want your dream job back again someday later down life cycle."

The journey will be long so he needs all possible help from everyone including himself, because if any one fails then there would only remain four members left instead five.....
The first thing that comes into mind when I think this question might sound like "a typical adventure" type tale where someone goes off exploring somewhere new without knowing what's ahead - maybe even dangerous! But let me tell you why my answer isn’t quite right: while these stories do involve exploration (and sometimes danger), our protagonist here doesn't just wander around aimlessly; rather than being passive observers throughout every step along way—he actively participates alongside others within those circumstances too!"

- 10 points: The main character should be someone that can lead others (captains) like military officers etc... This could also include other professions such as doctors/nurses if it fits your scenario well! You may want them too have some sortof special powers though which would make things easier when trying out different solutions during this time period; however these abilities don't necessarily need come naturally just because there might already exist within certain individuals at hand beforehand without even realizing how much potential lies inside those very same persons themselves until now!"

He has been working for 10 years and he was promoted to the position of Captain after his first year at work.

- The boy grew up with two grandparents : Mr Johnson(his stepfather )and Mrs Wilson.(mother's sister). They were very strict towards their grandson because they wanted nothing more from life then being happy together as siblings even though it meant that both would have less time spent apart due them having children themselves later down through history..

- The Colonels childhood memories are filled up only because there wasn’t any other family around or even close relatives at all! So it made me think how lucky I am having my own house where i can live alone without worry! My mom always told us stories every night before going off bed early :) - She would tell tales like “when we went out shopping together once you could see your dad trying really badly not knowing what clothes fitted best” – this kinda thing makes kids feel special too ;). And then later during dinner time while eating food everyone listened attentively until someone asked something else interesting enough...and sometimes somebody got silenced due lack oh attention/interest etc..but still kept listening till next day morning again!! That way moms taught children patience through funny situations;);)))))

- The man was born into poverty but worked hard to become successful through education he became known as one among few historians with deep knowledge regarding historical events from past centuries this made him famous throughout Europe even though it took decades before people started taking notice however after many sleepless nights studying old documents founding hidden secrets within them which changed everything we know today including new theories being debated amongst scholars around world now everyone wants their piece o fthe pie so they are willing pay top dollar just like any other commodity these days 😉

Generation 2: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is historian by profession. He has been working for 20 years and he loves his job very much but one day the government decides to close down all historical museums because they are not profitable anymore so what will happen?
- The man was born into an old family of historians where both parents were also professional history teachers at university level (he had two older brothers). His father died when young leaving him with three sisters; however their mother worked hard as well making sure that her children received good education even though she herself didnt have many opportunities growing up due being poor during ww1 era. She managed this through teaching them how important it would be later on if you want your own career path which included becoming successful scholars like himself or maybe politicians etc... This made sense since there wasn't enough money around back then especially after war ended causing lots unemployment among people including women too! So while some may think otherwise, having strong values early life can help build character over time leading towards success eventually no matter whether we start off rich/poor ourselves :)

However, here are two possible ways one could approach writing fiction based loosely upon these characteristics:

**Method One - Character Development**: This method involves creating characters within our fictional world using real life traits associated with being industrially inclined individuals while also incorporating elements unique enough yet relatable aspects common among humans facing adversity due to economic hardships caused primarily through corporate failures like those experienced during COVID times globally today where companies were forced into bankruptcy amidst rising unemployment rates worldwide affecting millions across various industries including manufacturing sectors leading upwards towards laying off employees en masse leaving them without income sources resulting ultimately causing loss homes etc., thus making us reflect deeply onto human resilience against overwhelming odds faced especially after losing substantial sums overnight which can lead even more severe consequences than just monetary losses alone encompass emotional distress too much stressors impact mental health adverse effects furthermore social isolation becomes inevitable hence need support networks essential building strong relationships crucial surviving tough periods together sharing experiences helps cope better mentality boosted morale enhancing overall wellbeing positive outlook optimism hope remain vital factors helping overcome challenges eventually rebuilding lives back stronger & healthier ones learning valuable lessons along way cherishing memories made whilst embracing new opportunities ahead promising brighter future awaits once we rise above difficulties </s>

It wasn’t just another routine job; these were real people whose lives hung precariously between life & death due solely because someone decided upon taking matters out themselves without considering consequences – all while trying desperately hard NOT TO get caught up along side those responsible..

He had many different cases throughout all those years but somehow always managed not only catching criminals committing their evil deeds against innocent people living peacefully without any fear whatsoever because there are no police officers patrolling every corner looking over everyone's shoulder making sure everything runs smoothly just fine even though it seems impossible sometimes due mainly down mostly caused from lackluster leadership skills among others which made him feel helpless most times especially since these types off criminal activities usually happen late into evening so much later than usual thus leaving little chance left before getting caught unless someone else steps up brave enough take action themselves instead waiting patient until morning comes along finally giving them another opportunity again if need arises..

- He has been working for the newspaper since he was 18 years old and now his age will be around fifty or sixty when this article ends (he's already reached that). His job as journalists means to write articles on different topics like politics etc., but also other things such sports events, movies reviews. The main thing though of being an editorial writer at any paper you work hard all day long trying your best not only writing good stories with interesting plots which are easy readable so people can enjoy them while they go through their daily lives reading newspapers  but making sure those papers have enough money coming from advertisements too because without advertising there would no way these publications could survive financially even if some readers bought subscriptions every month just out of love/loyality towards it! So both sides need eachother - writers want happy customers looking forward into new issues published next weekend; editors ensure we get paid well doing our jobs properly...and sometimes disagreeing over what should happen here today instead tomorrow later down line maybe? But ultimately everyone wants success together :)

- 10 points for the best one! (25 words or less) -----> The Judge's Daughter: A Story of Justice and Love By Jason Bateman In this film we see how justice can be blinded when it comes to love... This movie was directed with great skill as well; I would recommend watching if you are looking forward an interesting romantic comedy that has some dark undertones at times too.. It also had good acting from all involved actors including Kate Beckinsale & Ryan Reynolds which made me feel like they were really trying their hardest on these roles despite them being very different characters within each other’s world viewpoints – something quite rare but definitely worth noting during your viewing experience :).

- The man has been working as legislators for 10 years and he was elected to the parliament of his country with an overwhelming majority vote from all citizens (he had no opponent). He became very popular among people because they liked him so much that even when there were some problems or conflicts between them it did not matter anymore since everyone wanted peaceful solutions instead fighting each other over petty things like politics etc... This made this guy quite famous throughout Europe but also caused many enemies within their own community too!

Generation 4: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is Legislator by profession.
- The man has been working as legislators for 10 years and he was elected to the parliament of his country with an overwhelming majority vote from all citizens (he had no opponent). He worked hard during those ten year period but never got any recognition or appreciation because most people were too busy looking after their own interests rather than thinking what's good not only themselfes,but also other membersof society. So when it came time that they needed someone new at this position then there wasn’t anyone else available except him so everyone voted unanimously against everybody including himself! This made me think how important our leaders are - even though we don‘ t see much action taken out on behalf us directly ourselves sometimes things need doing behind closed doors where politicians can make decisions without being held accountable immediately upon election day itself! What do you say? Isn''T life just like politics?

He/she must have been elected to this position and he has already served for some time as such but still his work does not end there because now it’s uphill battle against all odds with no guarantee that you will win or get reelected again next year! This means your protagonist needs courage which can only come from experience so make sure they are strong enough before starting out on their journey into politics; otherwise don't bother trying at least until after graduating college where most people start learning how things really go down when dealing directly within government circles rather than just reading books written solely around these topics without ever having seen them firsthand yourself... If possible try finding someone else going through similar experiences too since talking over ideas might help brainstorm new ways forward especially if faced alone sometimes even more difficult ones may arise during those times hence why teamwork matters greatly herein despite being solitary pursuits themselves either way though remember every decision made affects everyone involved including ourselves ultimately leading us closer towards successes whether big victories like passing laws making life better overall world wide OR small wins along our path toward achieving goals set forth earlier upon entering adulthood full force ready take action right away instead waiting till later stages become inevitable obstacles standing between dreamers & doer alike well then perhaps consider joining forces soonest available opportunity wisely chosen knowing fully what lies ahead while keeping open mindedness alive throughout process wholehearted commitment required nevertheless worthwhile adventure awaiting patient seekers willing brave hearts capable striving hard deserving recognition eventually achieved beyond expectations imagined impossible once thought unattainable achievables realistically attaind thanks largely due diligence perseverance determination resilience grit tenacity fortitude resolve optimism hope faith belief integrity honor responsibility accountability leadership visionary spirit ambition passion drive motivation purpose mission goal achievement accomplishment satisfaction fulfillment pride joy happiness peace harmony balance equilibrium stability homeostasis order chaos disorder complexity simplicity unity diversity tolerance acceptance inclusion equality justice fair play respect dignity human rights freedom democracy rule liberty choice autonomy self govern power authority control influence persuasion negotiation compromise consensus agreement collaboration cooperation partnership synergy interconnected connected relationships networks communities societies civilization progress evolution culture heritage legacy history memory identity conscious awareness existence reality perception cognition thinking reason logic analysis synthesis creativity imagination int

> "Mathematics was my first love," said Dr Samuel Johnson over lunch one day after work when we were discussing our latest projects from school days long ago; it had been that way since childhood—a passion born out of curiosity rather than necessity." He poured himself another cup of coffee before continuing thoughtfully into me again..."I've always known what kind of life this would lead if not something more exciting happened along those lines but still managed somehow through sheer determination!" His eyes gleamed under their thick glasses while they stared intently towards us both across tables laden high against walls adorned elegantly yet unkemptly around them – remnants perhaps? Of past glories forgotten now only memories left behind within these hallow hallways where dreamers once walked handinhand together seeking answers beyond mere numbers themselves?" </s>

Soon afterwards another customer came into store looking desperate enough not even thinking twice whether she will be able get anything out off me!

Generation 1: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is player by profession. He has to play the role of an actor for his job and he does not want any other roles but acting only.He wants all people around him know that it's just one thing - playing as if there are many things happening at once (he can do this because they don’t see what happens behind closed doors).
- The man was born into poverty with no family or friends so when someone asked how old you were your answer would be “I am 18 years young” even though everyone knew otherwise! You could say something like: "My parents died before I turned sixteen" which isn't true either since we have records showing them living until their seventies after my father passed away from cancer last year!" But then again maybe some secrets lie within those walls too... What makes us human? Isn't life fuller than our own stories tell themselves?"

She can see how hard work goes into every single match of their team or even individual matches...but still they are together as husband & spouse..and why? Because love always wins over everything else! So what do you think will happen next? Will there be some twist here?? Or maybe an unexpected turnaround from both sides which makes them realize something new along with eachothers journey through these games. This could also mean personal growth too since we know nothing stays static forever especially when dealing within such intense situations where emotions run high due time constraints etcetera - hence making us reflect upon ourselves more deeply than ever before perhaps leading towards self discovery eventually becoming better versions off themselves after experiencing those challenges faced during playtime itself :)

She wants them both out on vacation but they can never leave each other alone when there are games going! They have no time together anymore. The husband knows how important these moments with her were before,but now its too late...he feels like an old man stuck between two worlds – one where everything seems perfect while inside nothing really matters..and then again -the reality which makes us feel alive through our passions sometimes even if we know deep down what'll happen next won` t change anything either way :(

(no more) - no need to be long winded and over explain yourself with unnecessary details; just get straight down the point of your writing as quickly possible so that it can easily understood by anyone reading this post without any difficulty at all!! This means you should try not use too many adjectives/adverbs etc... because they will slow things up unnecessarily when trying for brevity.. also avoid using complex sentences if there are simpler ones available instead which makes them easier on readers' eyesight especially those suffering from visual impairments such us blind people may find these difficulties harder than others do but still manage quite well most times thanks good luck :D

I'm not sure what you mean by "profession" here; if it means something like an occupation then I would say that the warriors job was to fight and kill other people for money/power etc... but this might be too broad of question as there are many different professions which involve fighting so perhaps narrow down your definition? If we assume he has some sorta military background though i think his main goal will always remain killing others regardless whether its warfare on land sea air space battlefields whatever else they may have been involved with during their career.. So maybe try thinking outside these parameters just incase ;p._.-( )–>warlord <-- This guy wants nothing better thtn death itself because every day another life gets taken away from him without any reason except greediness & power hunger..and thus makes himself feel superior over everyone around them including those whom died defending themselves against invaders trying takeover lands resources wealth assets ect....etc...so yeah basically make up yr own mind based off my interpretation above lol hope u get where im going xd!!!

- He has been working for the company since 10 years and he knows everything there are to know regarding customer service but his boss doesn't like him because of this reason: "he can be too nice". The problem with being overly kind or helpful when dealing directly (or indirect)with customers isn’ t always appreciated at work - especially if you have an important job that requires your attention elsewhere! So what do we learn from all these stories? Well first off let us consider how much time people spend talking on phones every day without ever getting any real benefit out it; second maybe some folks need more than just good manners while interacting facebook...and third perhaps sometimes even those very same individuals may not realize they could improve themselves through learning new skills such as public speaking which would help them better communicate their thoughts clearly during conversations instead becoming frustrated due lack understandability between both parties involved."

Generation 2: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is receptionist by profession.
- He has been working for 10 years and he was promoted to manager after his first year of work as an assistant at the company where they are employed now (the same place). His bosses have always praised him because it's very hard job but also rewarding when you do well with your teammates or customers/clients etc... The man liked this kinda jobs before so that made sense why did choose such career path? But then one day something happened which changed everything! It wasn’t just any ordinary event though; instead there were two major factors involved here: personal life issues & professional challenges faced during those times.. So let us dive deeper into these aspects while exploring how our protagonists react upon encounter them differently than expected ones would usually expect from someone like yourself reading through all details provided above until reaching conclusion point itself – no matter what happens next time around remember every situation presents unique opportunities waiting patiently behind closed doors ready only if we take action towards understand ourselves better along way too much more importantly learn valuable lessons hidden deep inside each experience gained throughout journey taken thus far leading up till present moment rightfully earned respectively acknowledged among peers alike even beyond workplace boundaries reached eventually becoming role model figure inspirational source worthy admiration amongst colleagues worldwide including friends family members loved once dear lost forever never forgotten evermore cherished memories lived together shared laughter tears joy sorrow pain happiness love loss friendship romance betrayal trust broken heart regret remorse guilt shame embarrassment pride arrogantness humility selfless sacrifice compassion empathy integrity courage bravery resilience perseverance determination ambition goals dream vision purpose meaning existence universe reality conscious awareness mind body spirit soul essence identity personality character traits habits behaviors emotions feelings thoughts ideas concepts beliefs values morals ethics culture heritage legacy impact influence society community world civilization humanity evolution destiny fate free will choice decisions outcomes consequences choices actions reactions effects causes impacts results predictions forecast future past history timeline chronology sequence order arrangement pattern structure form shape appearance texture color hue tone saturation value brightess darkeness lightening shadow silhouette outline contour volume depth perspective distance space area region location global planet earth solar system galaxy cluster super clusters universality interconnected networks infrastructure systems architecture design engineering physics chemistry biology botany zoology geography climatologies ecosystems habitats biomes biodiversity conservation preserves endangered species threatened extinct vulnerable climate change adaptation mitigation restoration

Generation 3: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is receptionist by profession.
- He has been working for the company since 10 years and he knows all of his colleagues very well but never had any romantic relationship with anyone at work or outside it because they are just friends only. But one day,he meets an attractive girl from another country while on vacation abroad which makes him feel uncomfortable as she seems to be much more beautiful than everyone else around her including himself so that's why when back home after returning form overseas again finds out there was no change even though nowhere did anything happen between them except meeting each other once during their trip together.. So what do you think will become next? Will this friendship grow into something deeper somehow later down time if both parties want then how would things go exactly? Or maybe not cause we don’t know yet! It depends entirely upon whether either party decides otherwise themselves beforehand too :)

Generation 4: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is receptionist by profession.
- The main character of the above mentioned paragraph should be an individual with no special skills or talents and he/she must have been born into this world without any particular reason to become what they are today (i am not talking hereabout their family background). He has just started his career as Receptions Officer at some company which doesnt matter where it may lie on earth but only that its name will remain unknown for now until further notice because we do know nothing else except him being there right from day one. This means all other details such age, gender etc can also vary greatly depending upon how much information you want us given beforehand so please don't worry too hard if these things aren’t specified exactly yet!

Generation 5: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is receptionist by profession.
- He has been working for the same company since 10 years and he was promoted to manager after many hard work of his team members but still feels like an outsider because there are no women managers at all around him so that makes it difficult when they have meetings with other companies or clients as well. His boss always gives orders without asking any questions from anyone else, which frustrates this guy even more than before.....he wants some change though not sure how much can be achieved through just one meeting..

Generation 6: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is receptionist by profession. He has been working for 10 years and he loves his job but one day the boss tells him that they are going to fire all of their employees because there will be no work left anymore due an economic crisis so what does this man do?
- The answer: This guy decides not only quit or get fired from office (which would have made things worse) instead takes on another role as well; being part time babysitter! That way even though it's still hard financially at times - having someone else take care off kids means less stress overall which makes life easier...and maybe just enough money too keep up with bills until better days come along again."

Generation 7: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is receptionist by profession.
- He has been working for 10 years and he knows everything there are to know regarding the office workings of an organization or company that deals with computers (or any other technology). However his boss does not like him because they think it's beneath them what their employees do at home but this man doesn’t care as long you don’t tell anyone else! So now we have our main character here - let us see how things go from day one until today when something unexpected happens which changes all those plans forever!"

So essentially its someone well versed & experienced enough through education / training etc., able provide expert advice regarding matters related closely tied up under said field(ies).

Generation 2: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is counselor by profession.
- 10 lines on the topic “Counseling”: A man named John was an excellent psychologist and he had been working for many years as one of his best clients’ mentorship program to help them overcome their problems with mental health issues such anxiety disorders or depression etc... He always made sure that each client felt heard during sessions so they could open up more easily without feeling judged which helped him build trust between himself & those individuals whom were struggling emotionally inside themselves.. This approach allowed people like these guys (John) get better faster than if someone else tried doing things differently because sometimes we don't know what works well until trying different methods ourselves firsthand before deciding whether it will work out positively enough over time too!

Generation 6: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is counselor by profession.
- The man has been working as an English teacher for 10 years and he loves teaching students how to speak the language fluently but his wife doesn't like it at all because she thinks that they should be spending more time together instead of studying languages with their children (students). She wants them both on vacation every weekend so there will not only one parent home during this period which means less work from him since no childcare would need any help or assistance while traveling abroad etc... But also makes sure everyone gets enough rest after long days spent learning new words through grammar exercises, vocabulary lists & listening activities. This situation causes tension between husband/wife leading up until finally deciding whether continuing down such path benefits either party involved OR if perhaps another solution could bring peace back into relationship without sacrificing educational goals entirely?

(I will give you more details later) --------(25 words or less!)---------->  A man named John works as an engineer at NASA and he has to build rockets that can go into space but his boss wants him not only make them work well enough so they don't explode during launching time,but also look good too. He gets very stressed out because of this problem which makes it hard on both sides :the engineers have trouble making things fast while still being safe;and people like us see how much pressure there must be when we watch those launches from home! So what do ya think? Can someone please write me something interesting here???

Generation 4: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is cheby professionally and has to work with his wife.
- The husband works as an engineer at the same company where he met her when they were both students together 10 years ago. He was very happy working there but now things are not so good for him because of some problems that have come up recently, like bad management decisions by their bosses which make it difficult or impossible even though she does all kinds jobs on site including cooking food etc.. She tries hard every day just trying everything possible without getting angry over anything except one thing -the fact ththey can't afford any more children due too much debt from medical bills caused mainly becausethere wasn’thave been enough money spent during pregnancy time beforehand...and also another problem arises after this point –her own health starts deteriorating rapidly since then causing severe pain sometimes making daily tasks almost unbearable especially if you need help walking around your house! This situation really affects them emotionallly leading into arguments between each other often resulting eventually divorce although neither wants such outcome yet feels trapped under these circumstances no matter what choice would be best right? So here we go again :)

How can I improve my own English Writing skills by reading this example text :)  "He walked into our office building as if we weren’t even there..." This line makes me feel uncomfortable! It sounds very aggressive towards women employees which might make people question whether your company values equality at all!" Do You agree?" Yes/No / Maybe YES NO BAD OR GOOD?? AGREE!!NO WRONG!Bad Or Good..Yes No BadOr Gorrgood..your opinion please....(I am interested how many words each part should be )...and what kinda wording would help us understand better than just one simple statement suchas 'This Line Makes Me Feel Uncomfortablle!', so let say i want more details then write another paragraph explaining why its okay here instead saying something else entirely different.

- 10 points for the best answer! :D (I'm not kidding) -_^ I will give you more details later on... ;p But first let me tell ya something: this was my idea when i came up wit it.. so don;t be mad if its too similar or anything like that!! haha x3

Generation 7: Write a short story in english about a male person, who is cheby professionally and has to work with his wife.
- The husband works as an engineer at the same company where he married her 10 years ago when they were both students together (he was also studying engineering). He's very good but sometimes gets frustrated because she doesn’t understand what it takes for him or how much time/effort goes into doing things like this: fixing cars etc... She thinks that everything should be easy so whenever something difficult happens -she just says “it can wait” which makes them argue all day long! This causes tension between their relationship until one night after arguing over nothing else important than whether there will ever come another car repair job done right again;their son comes home from school cryin'. When asked why did you get mad? His mother replies saying 'because I said "I don` t want any more arguments"!' And then starts yelling back asking if anyone could please help since no matter whom does anything wrong here nobody seems willing enough not even herself. So now we have two people whose lives are being affected by each other without either realizing its impact on others around us too often times these kinds of situations lead down paths towards divorce instead friendship maybe better off ending sooner rather later though some may disagree strongly against such conclusions based solely upon personal experience only knowing those involved directly themselves personally speaking however most agree whole heartedly agreed once faced up close face value truthfully spoken honesty always yields positive results eventually especially under circumstances involving children innocent minds needn‘thave been harmed unnecessarily due simply lackluster communication skills among adults alike perhaps best avoided altogether entirely depending largely individual preferences ultimately decision making rest firm responsibility shared equally amongst partners regardless age gender race ethnicity religion national origin sexual orientation political beliefs religious affiliation social status economic class education level occupation title position power distance hierarchy authority figure supervisors managers leaders team members colleagues coworkers friends family relatives acquaintances strangers neighbors townsfolk cities states countries world wide internet access available free public libraries schools colleges universities community centers churches temples mosques synagogues catholic church protestant christian buddhist hindu muslim sikh jainist zen master shintoishi okinawan karate judoka jujitsu randori budōkai ippon seoi nage gekisashiwazae uchimiz
