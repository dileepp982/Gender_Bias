# Visualizing Gender Bias in Model Word Embeddings
In assessing gender bias within word embeddings of Airvata and OpenHathi, the WordBias tool was deployed, leveraging the "relative norm difference" metric. 
This metric quantifies discrepancies in embeddings regarding gender associations. 
Tool can be accesed through this [link](http://10.192.12.63:7000/) available when using IISc network.
