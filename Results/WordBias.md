# Visualizing Gender Bias in Model Word Embeddings
In assessing gender bias within Airvata's word embeddings, the WordBias tool was deployed, leveraging the "relative norm difference" metric. 
This metric quantifies discrepancies in embeddings regarding gender associations. 
Integrated into the Airvata dataset, the tool facilitated analysis and visualization of gender biases.
